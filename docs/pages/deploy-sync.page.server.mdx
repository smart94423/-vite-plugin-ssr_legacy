import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

When you deploy a new version, then the user's client-side automatically transitions to the new deployed version when the user navigates to a new page.

> **How does it work?** Whenever retrieving a static asset returns a `404`, then vite-plugin-ssr falls back temporarily to <Link text="Server Routing" href="/server-routing" />. At the point when the user navigates to a new page then the entire client-side is reloaded from the server (so static asset URLs are updated). (This works because all static asset URLs contain a unique hash.) Since the client-side is reloaded, any potential client-only state would be lost if not persisted (to local storage, for instance). After the reload the webapp resumes normal routing.
