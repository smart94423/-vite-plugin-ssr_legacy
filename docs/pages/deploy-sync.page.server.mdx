When you deploy a new version, then any user currently browsering your (now outdated) frontend will automatically transition to the new deployed frontend as soon as the user navigates to a new page.

This works for both
<Link text="Server Routing" href="/server-routing" />
and
<Link text="Client Routing" href="/client-routing" />.

Everything is handled automatically and there is nothing for you to do.

> **What is the deployment synchronization problem?**
>
> The problem is this: when you deploy a new frontend, what should happen to your users that are currently browsing your frontend?
>
> If you do nothing, and if your app uses Client Routing, then your users may end up a very long time on your outdated frontend with outdated client-side JavaScript. This may lead to many problems such as out-of-sync data requests and mutations.
>
> Reloading the page of your users as soon as a new frontend deployment is detected is a no-go: it disrupts your user's activity on your website and your user may lose ephemeral client-side state such as the text entered in a form or in a comment textarea.
>
> What many websites do is to show a little popup to users saying "a new version is available, click here to reload". But this solution is far from ideal.
>
> What vite-plugin-ssr does instead is that it falls back to Server Routing: the next time the user navigates to a new page, the page does a full reload so that the user gets the new frontend.

> **How does vite-plugin-ssr's solution work?**
>
> To mitigate the problem, vite-plugin-ssr temporarily falls back to <Link text="Server Routing" href="/server-routing" /> whenever retrieving a static asset returns a `404`: the URL of all static assets contain a unique hash and, consequently, when the user natvigates to a new page then the old client requests static asset URLs that don't exist anymore.
>
> With Server Rotuing, when the user natvigates to a new page, the entire client-side is reloaded. After the reload, Client Routing is used again.
>
> Note that, since the client-side is reloaded, any potential client-only state is lost if not persisted (to local storage, for instance).
>
> So far, this technique has shown to work out for all users, but if it doesn't work for you then open a new GitHub issue.
