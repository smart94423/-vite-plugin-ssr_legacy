import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

When you deploy a new version, then the user's client-side automatically transitions to the new deployed version when the user navigates to a new page.

> **How does it work?** Whenever retrieving a static asset returns a `404`, then vite-plugin-ssr fallsback to <Link text="Server Routing" href="/server-routing" />. This effectively reloads the entire client-side when the user navigates to a new page. (This works because all static asset URLs contain a unique hash.)

> It works automatically and there is nothing for you to do.

> So far, this technique has shown to be reliable, but if it doesn't work out for you, then open a new GitHub issue.
