import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

To avoid loading/rendering a client-only component on the server-side, we can:
 - Render our page as SPA, see <Link href="/render-modes" />.
 - Render our page with SSR while we load & render the component only on the browser-side, see <Link href="/dynamic-import" />.

> **Client-only components**
>
> Some component libraries are meant to work only in the browser,
> such as [react-leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet) or [vue-leaflet](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet).
>
> Many such client-side only components support being server-side rendered. (Rendering an empty shell on the server-side while replacing that empty shell with the actual component on the browser-side.)
>
> But some client-only component don't support being server-side rendered, and some even crash when they are merely loaded on the server-side.
