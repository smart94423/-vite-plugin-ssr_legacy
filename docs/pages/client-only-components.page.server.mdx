Some component libraries are meant to work only in the browser,
such as [react-leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet) or [vue-leaflet](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet).

Most such client-only libraries nowadays support being server-side rendered. (Rendering an empty shell on the server-side while replacing that empty shell on the browser-side with the "real" component.)

But some client-only libraries still don't support being server-side rendered, and some even crash when they are loaded on the server-side.

To avoid loading client-only components on the server-side, we can:
 - Render our page as SPA, see <Link href="/render-modes" />.
 - Render our page with SSR while we load & render such components only on the browser-side, see <Link href="/dynamic-import" />.
