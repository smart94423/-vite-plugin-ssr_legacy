From a Docker perspective, a `vite-plugin-ssr` app is just a Node.js server, so we can use any Node.js server Docker configuration.

If we want to use Docker for development as well, we need to properly configure Docker for the HMR port.

If we use Windows with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/), we need to to configure [`chockidar`](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) to use polling. (Vite uses `chockidar`.)

> "dev": "CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true npm run server"

Note that [it has been reported](https://discord.com/channels/815937377888632913/815937377888632916/910110118375489567) that [vite.config.js#server.watch.usePolling](https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-watch) doesn't work.
