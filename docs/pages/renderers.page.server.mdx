Built-in renderers are full-fledged integrations with UI frameworks.

The following integrations are currently being worked on:
 - `vike-react`
 - `vike-vue`
 - `vike-solid`

> Vike is the upcoming new name for vite-plugin-ssr, see [#736](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/736).

Contribution welcome to create renderers for other UI frameworks such as Svelte.
