import { Link } from 'vikepress'

A frequent problem with SSR is that some component libraries,
such as [react-leaflet](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet) or [vue-leaflet](https://github.com/vue-leaflet/vue-leaflet),
only work in the browser.

Server-side rendering such components will crash our Node.js server.

With `vite-plugin-ssr`, there are two ways to handle client-only components:
 - We render our page as SPA, see <Link href="/render-modes" />.
 - We render our page with SSR while we load & render such components only in the browser-side, see <Link href="/dynamic-import" />.
