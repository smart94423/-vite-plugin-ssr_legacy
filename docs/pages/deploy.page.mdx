## Agnostic Middleware

From an architectural point of view, `vite-plugin-ssr` is just a server middleware that can be used in any server environment.

<ServerMiddleware />

## Server Bundling

To enable bundlers we load a special file `dist/server/importBuild.js`.

> `dist/server/importBuild.js` helps bundlers discover the entire dependency tree.

Examples:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers' /> &mdash; Cloudflare Workers needs the entire worker code to be bundled into a single file.
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vercel' /> &mdash; Vercel bundles our serverless functions behind the scenes.

## Conclusion

We can integrate `vite-plugin-ssr` in any server environment we want.
