A vite-plugin-ssr framework uses the same interface as a regular vite-plugin-ssr app: the only difference is that some page files (e.g. <Link text={<><code>/renderer/_default.page.server.js</code></>} href="/default-page" />) live in `app/node_modules/framework/` instead of `app/`.

Your framework can include more functionnality beyond vite-plugin-ssr such as a custom server, a CLI, deployment, etc.


## Basics

A basic vite-plugin-ssr framework provides the renderer so that the user doesn't have to implement it:

```bash
# Renderer implemented by the framework
node_modules/framework/renderer/_default.page.server.js
node_modules/framework/renderer/_default.page.client.js

# User page files
pages/index.page.js
pages/about.page.js
```

The framework takes care of the UI framework (React, Vue, ...) integration: all the framework's users have left to do is to define UI components and `/pages/**/*.page.js` files.

> **Progressively build your framework**. We recommend to build your framework progressively by first implementing a normal vanilla vite-plugin-ssr app (i.e. without any framework). Once you're satisfied with the architecture of your vanilla vite-plugin-ssr app, you start creating your own framework (e.g. by moving `renderer/` to your newly created framework).

> **Work-in-progress**: this page will include examples of such basic vite-plugin-ssr frameworks.


## More

A vite-plugin-ssr framework is just a framework that includes page files. Beyond that, there is nothing special about vite-plugin-ssr frameworks and you can include anything you want to your framework, such as a custom server (e.g. Express.js), a CLI, deployment (e.g. Cloudflare Workers), error tracking (e.g. Sentry), etc.

So that, all your framework's users have left to do is: define UI components, and define data models (if your framework has a database).

> **Work-in-progress**: this page will include examples of such frameworks.
