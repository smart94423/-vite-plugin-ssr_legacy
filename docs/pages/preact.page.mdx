`vite-plugin-ssr` is view framework agnostic; many users are using the plugin with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/).

To get started, we can scaffold a React app with `$ npm init vite-plugin-ssr@latest` and then replace React with Preact.

PR adding (a link to) a Preact + `vite-plugin-ssr` example is welcome.
