We can choose between two routing strategies:
 - Server-side Routing (for a simpler architecture)
 - Client-side Routing (for faster and animated page transitions)

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Server-side Routing,
which is the "old school way" of doing routing:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the browser completely loads the new page.

If you don't have a strong rationale for doing something differently, then stick to Server-side Routing as it leads to a simpler architecture.

That said, `vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for Client-side Routing and you can opt-in with [`useClientRouter()`](/useClientRouter).

With Client-side Routing,
when the user navigates to a new page,
only minimal DOM changes are applied
instead of doing a full HTML reload.

Client-side Routing enables:
- Slightly faster page transitions.
- Custom animated page transitions.

Since Server-side Routing leads to a simpler architecture,
we recommend using Client-side Routing only with a strong rationale to prioritize performance over simplicity.
