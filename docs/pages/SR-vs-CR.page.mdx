We can choose between two routing strategies:
 - Server Routing (for a simpler app architecture)
 - Client Routing (for faster and animated page transitions)

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Server Routing,
which is the "old school way" of doing routing:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the browser completely loads the new page.

If we don't have a rationale for doing something differently, then we should stick to Server Routing as it leads to a simpler app architecture.

That said, `vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for Client Routing and we can opt-in with [`useClientRouter()`](/useClientRouter).

With Client Routing,
when the user navigates to a new page,
only minimal DOM changes are applied
instead of doing a full HTML reload.

Client Routing enables:
- Slightly faster page transitions.
- Custom animated page transitions.

Since Server Routing leads to a simpler app architecture,
we recommend using Client Routing only with a rationale to prioritize performance over simplicity.

We should keep in mind that simple architecture => faster dev speed => more features for our user. Does our user care more about features or about slightly faster page transitions?

> While frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt make it seem like using Client Routing is easy, it actually comes with many inherent complexities that makes our life more difficult as we scale.

Client Routing is perfectly fine for certain apps, for example:
 - Simple websites, e.g. a portfolio/homepage.
 - Highly polished apps such as Netflix.

Either way, we should make a conscious decision about it.
