`vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for both Server-side Routing and Client-side Routing.

## Server Routing

Server Routing is the "old school way" of doing routing:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the the HTML of the new page loaded.

Server Routing leads to a simpler app architecture and, consequently, to a faster app development.

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Server Routing.

## Client Routing

With Client Routing,
when the user navigates to a new page,
the DOM is mutated
instead of doing a full HTML reload.

Client Routing enables:
- Slightly faster page transitions.
- Preserved state across page changes. (See example below.)
- Custom page transition animations.

We can opt-in with [`useClientRouter()`](/useClientRouter).

## Which one to choose?

By default, we recommend Server Routing because it leads to a simpler app architecture.
We should keep in mind that simpler app architecture => faster app development => more features for our users. Do our users care more about features or about slightly faster page transitions?

We should use Client Routing only if we have a rationale.

> While frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt make Client Routing seem easy at first,
> it always comes with inherent complexity that makes scaling the architecture of Next.js/Nuxt apps more complex and thus slower.

Examples for using Client Routing:
 - Simple websites, such as a portfolio or landing/marketing website. Complexity is not an issue for simple websites while Client-side Routing gives a nice polished touch to the website.
 - Apps that need to be highly polished. For example Netflix's web app: Netflix aggressively pushes for delightful user experiences, and has the budget and man-power to do it. For entertainment apps, the highly polished user experience can be worth the added complexity of using Client Routing.
 - Web apps that need to maintain state across page changes. For example Spotify: the currently listened song should not be interrupted on page change.

On the other hand, as a Startup who wants to deliver an MVP as quickly as possible, Server Routing should be the default choice.
