We can choose between two routing strategies:
 - Server-side Routing (for a simpler architecture)
 - Client-side Routing (for faster and animated page transitions)

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Server-side Routing,
which is the "old school way" of doing routing:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the browser completely loads the new page.

If we don't have a strong rationale for doing something differently, then we stick to Server-side Routing as it leads to a simpler architecture.

That said, `vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for Client-side Routing and we can opt-in with [`useClientRouter()`](/useClientRouter).

With Client-side Routing,
when the user navigates to a new page,
only minimal DOM changes are applied
instead of doing a full HTML reload.

Client-side Routing enables:
- Slightly faster page transitions.
- Custom animated page transitions.

Since Server-side Routing leads to a simpler architecture,
we recommend using Client-side Routing only with a strong rationale to prioritize performance over simplicity.

We should keep in mind that simple architecture => faster dev speed => more features for our user. Does our user care more about features or about slightly faster page transitions?

> While frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt make it seem like using Client-side Routing is easy, it actually comes with many inherent complexities that make our life more difficult as we scale.

Client-side Routing is perfectly fine for certain apps, for example:
 - Simple websites such as a portfolio/homepage
 - Highly polished apps such as Netflix

But we should make a conscious decision about it.
