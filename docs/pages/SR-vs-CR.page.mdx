`vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for both Server-side Routing and Client-side Routing.

## Server Routing

Server Routing is the "old school way" of doing routing:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the HTML of the new page loaded.

Server Routing leads to a simpler app architecture and, consequently, to a higher development speed.

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Server Routing.

## Client Routing

With Client Routing,
when the user navigates to a new page,
the DOM is mutated
instead of doing a full HTML reload.

Client Routing enables:
- Faster page transitions.
- Preserved state across page changes. (We elaborate below.)
- Custom page transition animations.

We opt-in by using [`useClientRouter()`](/useClientRouter).

## Which one to choose?

By default, we recommend Server Routing because it leads to a simpler app architecture.

We should keep in mind that simpler app architecture => higher development speed => more features for our users. For example, as a startup that wants to deliver an MVP as quickly as possible, Server Routing is a sensible default choice.

That said, following situations warrant the use of Client Routing:
 - **Simple websites**. Such as a portfolio or landing/marketing website. Complexity is not an issue for simple websites and Client Routing gives a nice polished touch to the website.
 - **Highly polished apps**. For example Netflix's web app: Netflix aggressively pushes for delightful user experiences, and has the budget and man-power to do it. For entertainment apps, the highly polished user experience can be worth the added complexity.
 - Web apps that need to **preserve state across page changes**. For example Spotify: the currently listened song should not be interrupted on page change. Server Routing cannot preserve client-side state; we need Client Routing.
