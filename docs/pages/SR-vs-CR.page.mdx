`vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for both Server Routing and Client Routing.

## Server Routing

Server Routing is the "old school way" of doing routing:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the old page is completely discarded and the the HTML of the new page loaded.

Server Routing leads to a simpler app architecture and, consequently, to a faster app development.

By default, `vite-plugin-ssr` does Server Routing.

## Client Routing

With Client Routing,
when the user navigates to a new page,
the DOM is mutated
instead of doing a full HTML reload.

Client Routing enables:
- Slightly faster page transitions.
- Custom page transition animations.

We can opt-in with [`useClientRouter()`](/useClientRouter).

## Which one to choose?

In general, we recommend Server Routing because it leads to a simpler app architecture;
we recommend Client Routing only if we have a rationale to prioritize performance over simplicity.

We should keep in mind that simpler app architecture => faster app development => more features for our user. Does our user care more about features or about slightly faster page transitions?

Client Routing is perfectly fine for certain apps, for example:
 - Simple websites, such as portfolio, landing, or marketing pages. Complexity is not an issue for simple websites.
 - Highly polished apps, such as Netflix's web app. The added complexity is worth it (and Netflix has the budget and manpower to handle added complexity).

Either way, we should make a conscious decision about it.
