The `guard()` hook enables you to protect pages.

The most common use cases being authentication and authorization, see <Link href="/auth#login-flow" />.

Note that:

- It's always used together with <Link href="/render" text={<code>throw render()</code>} /> or <Link href="/redirect" text={<code>throw redirect()</code>} />. (The `guard()` hook doesn't accept any return value.)
- It can be asynchronous. (Unlike Route Functions which are always synchronous.)
- A single `guard()` hook can apply to multiple pages. (By using the usual inheritance rules.)
