Vite-plugin-ssr doesn't implement [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) by design, as we believe decoupling the API is a more robust approach.

Instead use:

- [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com)
  > Telefunc is a simple solution providing a much better DX than API routes. Out of all options, we recommend Telefunc most.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
  > Similar to Telefunc.
  >  - Con: Telefunc is simpler.
  >  - Pro: supports real-time endpoints with websockets.
- Use your server to create new HTTP endpoints (such as Express.js routes). That way you can get a DX similar to API routes.
  > If you use this technique then:
  >   - Make sure vite-plugin-ssr's middleware is your last middleware.
  >   - When modifying your server, you may need to manually restart your server for your changes to take effect.

- GraphQL
  <Warning>
    If you aren't a *very* large team, then GraphQL is most likely over-engineering. RPC (such as Telefunc and tRPC) is simpler, and
    actually more flexible as long as you aren't a very large team.

    We recommend getting started with RPC and use GraphQL only later if/when the need arises.
