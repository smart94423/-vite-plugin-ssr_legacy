Vite-plugin-ssr doesn't implement [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) by design.

> We believe decoupling the API from vite-plugin-ssr is a more robust approach.

Instead, use:

- [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com)
  > We recommend Telefunc: it's a simple solution providing a much improved DX over API routes.
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/)
  > Similar to Telefunc.
  >  - Con: Telefunc is simpler.
  >  - Pro: supports real-time endpoints with websockets.
- Directly use your server to create new HTTP endpoints (e.g. Express.js routes), for a DX similar to API routes of frameworks like Next.js.
  > As explained in <Link href="/renderPage" />:
  >   - Make sure vite-plugin-ssr's middleware is your last middleware.
  >   - When modifying your server, you may need to manually restart your server for your changes to take effect.
- GraphQL
  <Warning>
    If you aren't a *very* large team, then GraphQL is most likely over-engineering. RPC (Telefunc or tRPC) is simpler, and
    it's actually more flexible than GraphQL as long as you aren't a very large team.

    We recommend to get started with RPC and to later switch to GraphQL only if/when the need arises.
