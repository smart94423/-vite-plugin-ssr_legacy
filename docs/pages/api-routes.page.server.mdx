Vite-plugin-ssr doesn't implement [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) by design.

Instead, we can directly use our server (e.g. Express.js endpoints), or use an RPC implementation such as [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com) or [tRPC](https://trpc.io/).

> The vite-plugin-ssr maintainers believe that implementing APIs independently of vite-plugin-ssr is a superior approach.
