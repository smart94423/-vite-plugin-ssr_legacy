import { RepoLink } from 'libframe-docs/components/RepoLink'

We can use any routing library, such as Vue Router or React Router.
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-router/' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-router/' />

That said,
we recommend using `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router instead:
it's simpler and enough for the vast majority of apps.

Note that `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router supports:
 - [Nested Routes](/nested-routes)
 - [Client Routing](/useClientRouter)

So chances are that we don't need Vue Router nor React Router.
