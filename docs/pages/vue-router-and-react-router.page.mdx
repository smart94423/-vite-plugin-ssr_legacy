We can use any routing library, such as Vue Router or React Router.

Shallow integration: (React/Vue Router supersedes `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router.)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-router/' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-router/' />

Deep integration: (React/Vue Router works hand-in-hand with `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router.)
 - Vue Router: [work-in-progress](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/9#issuecomment-937477110).
 - React Router: should be possible using the [`onBeforeRoute()` hook](/onBeforeRoute).

That said, we recommend to only use `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router: it's fundamentally simpler.

> When doing SSR, there is no need for sophisticated routing libraries such as React Router or Vue Router.

Note that `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router supports:
 - [Nested Routes](/nested-routes)
 - [Client-side Routing](/useClientRouter)

> `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router has no known limitations:
> so far, any app and any feature have been able to be built with it.
