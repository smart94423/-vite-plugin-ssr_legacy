import { RepoLink } from 'libframe-docs/components/RepoLink'

We can use any routing library, such as Vue Router or React Router.
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-router/' />
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-router/' />

That said,
we recommend using only `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router:
it's simpler and enough for the vast majority of apps.

If we want to use Client-side Routing,
we can use `useClientRouter()`,
see [Server-side Routing VS Client-side Routing](/SR-vs-CR).
