import { Link } from 'vikepress'

Set to `true` to disable the automatic chaining of all the build steps.

```js
// vite.config.js

import { ssr } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [
    ssr({
      disableAutoFullBuild: true
    })
  ]
}
```

Running `$ vite build` executes the following steps:
 1. The client-side is build (`dist/client/`).
 1. The server-side is build (`dist/server/`).
 1. The pre-rendering of HTML files (if <Link text="pre-rendering is enabled" href="/pre-rendering" />).

When setting `disableAutoFullBuild` to `true` then only step `1.` is executed. To run the full build, we then have to:

 - Run `$ vite build`, to build the client-side (`dist/client/`).
 - Run `$ vite build --ssr`, to build the server-side (`dist/server/`).
 - Run the pre-rendering programmatically, see <Link href="/prerender-programmatic" />.

> We usually use `disableAutoFullBuild` when we want fain grain programmatic control over the build process.

> If our goal is to <Link text="programmatically run pre-rendering" href="/prerender-programmatic" /> then,
> instead, we can set <Link text={<code>prerender.disableAutoRun</code>} href="/prerender-config#disableautorun" /> to `true` as it merely disables the automatic pre-rendering run.
