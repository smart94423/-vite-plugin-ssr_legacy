We recommend to install [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) and define your environment variables in `.env` files.

```bash
# .env.production
# Only set in production
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:secret@example.com:5432

# .env.development
# Only set in development
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost

# .env
# Always set
EMAIL_USER=John Doe
# Use prefix VITE_ to make it accessible also to your client-side code
VITE_SOME_KEY=123
```

To access your environment variables:
 - For server-side code, you can access all your environment variables using `process.env` (e.g. `process.env.DATABASE_URL`).
 - For client-side code, you can access only `VITE_` prefixed environment variables and you have to use <ImportMeta prop='env' /> (e.g. <ImportMeta prop='env.VITE_SOME_KEY' />). Note that `process.env` isn't available on the client-side.

<Warning>
  As explained in [Vite's security note](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files:~:text=the%20envPrefix%20option.-,SECURITY%20NOTES,-.env.*.local%20files):
   - Never set secret information to environment variables prefixed with `VITE_`.
   - Use `.env.local` to avoid including secret information in your repository (e.g. if you make your repository public on GitHub).
</Warning>

For more information about `.env` files, see [Vite Docs > `.env` Files](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files).

> While Vite has built-in support for `.env` files, it only includes environment variables prefixed with `VITE_`. That's why you still need to install `dotenv` to be able to access all environment variables on the server-side.
