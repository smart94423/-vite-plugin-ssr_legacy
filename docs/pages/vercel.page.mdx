import { RepoLink } from './components/RepoLink'

We need to make sure to load `dist/server/importBuild.js` in our Vercel function. (Vercel bundles serverless functions behind the scenes; the `dist/server/importBuild.js` file loads all built modules in such a way that bundlers can determine the entire dependency tree at build-time.)

We need to run our build (`vite build && vite build --ssr`) in a `vercel-build` script instead of a `build` script. (Because Vercel discards all files generated during the `build` script, see [Vercel Docs - Custom Build Step for Node.js](https://vercel.com/docs/runtimes#advanced-usage/advanced-node-js-usage/custom-build-step-for-node-js) and conversation [here](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/6393#discussioncomment-1008607). Note that [`includeFiles` doesn't work for files that are not committed to the Git repository](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/issues/6478).)

To increase build caching performance, Vercel recommends using yarn instead of npm.

Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vercel/' />
