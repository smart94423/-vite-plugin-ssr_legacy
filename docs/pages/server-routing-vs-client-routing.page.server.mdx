import { ServerRouting, ClientRouting } from '../components'

`vite-plugin-ssr` has first-class support for both Server-side Routing and Client-side Routing.

## Server Routing

<ServerRouting />

## Client Routing

<ClientRouting />

## Which one to choose?

By default, we recommend Server Routing because it leads to a simpler app architecture.

> While frameworks such as Next.js and Nuxt make Client Routing seem easy at first,
> it always comes with inherent complexity that makes developing Next.js/Nuxt apps more complex and slower at scale.

In general, there are two things to consider:
 - There is a trade off between simplicity and performance.
 - If we need to preserve client-side state across navigation, then we have no choice than to use Client-side Routing.

That said, which one to use really depends on the use case.

#### Simple Websites

Apps with a simple architecture, such as portfolio or marketing websites, can afford the added complexity of Client Routing.
Client-side Routing can be worth it for having smooth page navigations giving such website a polished touch.

#### MVPs

As a startup that wants to deliver an MVP as quickly as possible, Server Routing is a sensible default choice. A simple app architecture leads to higher development speed which in turn leads to more features for our users.

Recommendation: Server-side Routing.

#### Highly polished apps

For example Netflix's web app: Netflix pushes for delightful user experiences, and has the budget and man-power to do it. For entertainment apps, the highly polished user experience can be worth the added complexity.

Recommendation: Client-side Routing.

#### Client-side state preserved across navigation

For example, on music players such as Spotify, the currently listened song should not be interrupted when the user navigates to a new page. Server Routing cannot preserve client-side state; we need Client Routing.

Requirement: Client-side Routing.

#### Third-party API

For example, if we use Shopify's or Facebook's GraphQL API,
then Client Routing enables page navigation without doing any request to our Node.js server:
when the user navigates to a new page,
the user's browser directly communicates with the Shopify/Facebook GraphQL API and our Node.js server is not involved at all.

The Shopify/Facebook GraphQL API may geographically live significantly closer to our user than our Node.js server; we may want to involve our Node.js server rather less than often.

Recommendation: Client-side Routing.
