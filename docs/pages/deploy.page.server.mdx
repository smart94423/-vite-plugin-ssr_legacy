## Agnostic Middleware

From an architectural point of view, `vite-plugin-ssr` is just a server middleware. It's versatile and we can use it any server environment we want.

<ServerMiddleware />

## Server Bundling

Some deploy services, such as Cloudflare Workers, bundle the entire server-side code into a single file.

To enable server bundling we load a special file [`dist/server/importBuild.js`](/importBuild.js).

Examples:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers' /> &mdash; Cloudflare Workers needs the entire worker code to be bundled into a single file.
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vercel' /> &mdash; Vercel bundles our serverless functions behind the scenes.

## Conclusion

We can use `vite-plugin-ssr` with any deploy strategy/service we want.
