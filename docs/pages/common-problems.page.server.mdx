## Libraries containing invalid ESM code

See explanation and solution at <Link href="/invalid-esm" />.

Errors thrown by Node.js:

```
To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.
```
```
import { SomeImport } from "some-library";
         ^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Named export 'SomeImport' not found. The requested module 'some-library' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.
CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:

import pkg from 'some-library';
const { SomeImport } = pkg;
```
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module 'node_modules/some-library/dist/esm/some-file' imported from node_modules/some-library/dist/esm/index.js
Did you mean to import some-file.js?
```

## Hydration mismatch

See explanation and solution at <Link href="/hydration-mismatch" />.

Errors thrown by **Vue** (in the browser):
```js
[Vue warn]: Hydration text mismatch:
 - Client: "foo"
 - Server: "bar"
   at <SomeComponent>
   at <App>
```
```
Hydration completed but contains mismatches.
```

Errors thrown by **React** (in the browser):
```
Warning: Text content did not match. Server: "foo" Client: "bar"
```
```
An error occurred during hydration. The server HTML was replaced with client content in <SomeComponent>.
```
```
Text content does not match server-rendered HTML.
```
```
Hydration failed because the initial UI does not match what was rendered on the server.
```
```
There was an error while hydrating. Because the error happened outside of a Suspense boundary, the entire root will switch to client rendering.
```
