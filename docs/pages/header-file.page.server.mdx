import { Link } from '@brillout/docpress'
import HeaderFileIntro from '../components/HeaderFileIntro.mdx'

> `+config.h.js` files are part of the <Link text="V1 design" href="/migration/v1-design" />.

<HeaderFileIntro />

This allows vite-plugin-ssr to load code in the right environment:

```js
// +config.h.js

// onRenderClient() should be loaded only on the client-side
import onRenderClient from './some-other-module'
// onRenderHtml() should be loaded only on the server-side
import onRenderHtml from './some-module'

export default { onRenderHtml, onRenderClient }
```

## Inline hooks code

Following is forbidden:

```js
// /pages/some-page/+config.h.js

export default {
  Page() {
    // ...
  },
  onBeforeRender() {
    // ...
  }
}
```

Vite-plugin-ssr throws:
```
[Wrong Usage] The code of config 'Page' cannot live inside /pages/some-page/+config.h.js
```

Do this instead:

```js
// /pages/some-page/+config.h.js

import Page from './some-file'
import onBeforeRender from './some-other-file'

export default { Page, onBeforeRender }
```


## Imports from same file

This is usually forbidden:

```js
// /pages/some-page/+config.h.js

// Importing from the same file
import { Page, onBeforeRender } from './same-file'

export default { Page, onBeforeRender }
```

This is only allowed if `Page` and `onBeforeRender` live in the same environment (which usually isn't the case).

> By default, `Page` is loaded on the client- and server-side while `onBeforeRender` is loaded only on the server-side.
> This means that importing `Page` and `onBeforeRender` from the same file is allowed only if <Link text={<code>meta</code>} href="/meta" /> is used in order to modify and align their environment.


## Not re-exported imports

If an imported value isn't exposed over `export default { ... }` then it isn't included in any runtime.

```js
// +config.h.js

// These imports aren't included in runtimes.
import { something } from './some-file'
// This import has no effect. (CSS should be imported in runtime code such as +Page.js instead.)
import './some.css'

// This log is printed only when vite-plugin-ssr loads the +config.h.js file.
// This log isn't included in neither the client runtime nor the server runtime.
console.log(something) // Prints: '_path:./some-file:something'

export default {
  // `something` isn't re-exported here
}
```
