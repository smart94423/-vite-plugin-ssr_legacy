## Error tracking

Errors can be tracked with `pageContext.errorWhileRendering`:

```js
// server.js

import { someErrorTracker } from 'some-error-tracker'
import { renderPage } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/server'

app.get('*', async (req, res) => {
  const pageContext = await renderPage({ urlOriginal: req.url })

  // An error occured during server-side rendering
  if (pageContext.errorWhileRendering) {
    someErrorTracker(pageContext.errorWhileRendering)
  }

  // ...
})
```

Allowing you to install the error tracking code of services such as [Sentry](https://sentry.io/), [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/), [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/), or your own custom error tracking.


## Verbose

Vite-plugin-ssr modifies transpilation errors (e.g. errors generated by [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)) to make them prettier and more succint.

While vite-plugin-ssr is careful about not removing relevant information, it may mistakenly do so. In that case, open a new GitHub issue and consider using `DEBUG=vps:error` until a vite-plugin-ssr maintainer fixes the issue.

```shell
# Original & verbose errors
DEBUG=vps:error npm run dev
```

> This debug flag only affects development and build. In production there isn't any transpilation (and, in general, vite-plugin-ssr is careful and strict about not interfering with errors in production).

For even more verbose errors:

```shell
# Usually only used by vite-plugin-ssr maintainers
DEBUG=vps:error,vps:log npm run dev
```
