The `onBeforeRoute()` hook gives us full control over the routing process and is usually used in order to:
 - [Internationalize a pre-rendered app](/i18n#with-pre-rendering)

We can also use it to:
 - [Implement a custom router](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/140)

> Using `onBeforeRoute()` for i18n is already used in production. **For any other use cases, open a GitHub ticket or reach out on Discord before starting to use `onBeforeRoute()`** (currently, `onBeforeRoute()` is purposely limited but the limitations can be lifted in order to unlock new capabilities).

Example:
- <Link href='/examples/i18n-prerender/renderer/_default.page.route.js' />
