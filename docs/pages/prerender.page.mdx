We usually use the `prerender()` hook to provide the list of URLs of a parameterized route (e.g.
`/movie/1` and `/movie/2` for `/movie/:id`).

If we don't have any parameterized route,
then we can pre-render our app without defining any `prerender()` hook.

Also,
we can use `prerender()` hooks to provide the `pageContext` of pages in a way that makes
the pre-rendering build process faster.

```js
// /pages/movie.page.route.js
// Environment: Node.js

export default '/movie/:movieId`
```
```js
// /pages/movie.page.server.js
// Environment: Node.js

export { prerender }

async function prerender() {
  const movies = await Movie.findAll()

  const moviePages = (
    movies
    .map(movie => {
      const url = `/movie/${movie.id}`
      const pageProps = { movie }
      const pageContext = { pageProps }
      return {
        url,
        // Beacuse we already provide the `pageContext`, vite-plugin-ssr will *not* call
        // the `onBeforeRender()` hook for `url`.
        pageContext
      }
      /* We could also only return `url` and not provide `pageContext`. In that case
       * vite-plugin-ssr would call the `onBeforeRender()` hook. But that would be wasteful
       * since we already have all the data of all movies from our `await Movie.findAll()` call.
       * Instead, we provide `pageContext` to make the pre-rendering build process faster.
       */
      // return { url }
    })
  )

  // We can also return URLs that don't match the page's route.
  // That way we can provide the `pageContext` of other pages.
  // Here we provide the `pageContext` of the `/movies` page since
  // we already have the data.
  const movieListPage = {
    url: '/movies', // Note how the URL `/movies` isn't part of the page's route `/movie/:movieId`
    pageContext: {
      pageProps: {
        // We filter out the data we don't need in order to minimize what is sent to the browser.
        // We explain this practice at https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/data-fetching
        movieList: movies.map(({id, title}) => ({id, title})
      }
    }
  }

  return [movieListPage, ...moviePages]
}
```

The `prerender()` hook is only used for pre-rendering:
if we don't call
`vite-plugin-ssr prerender`
then no `prerender()` hook is ever called.

> Providing `pageContext` in `prerender()` hooks
> should only be used for making the pre-rendering build process faster and
> we recommend against using `prerender()` for other purposes.
> For example, we should avoid providing `pageContext` in `prerender()` hooks that wouldn't otherwise exist;
> instead, we should make sure that our `onBeforeRender()` hooks provide all the `pageContext` we need.
> (Pre-rendering is only run for production; we should keep our app consistent between dev and prod.)
