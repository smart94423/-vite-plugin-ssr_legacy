While, in principle, it's possible to use vite-plugin-ssr with React Router or Vue Router by using the [`onBeforeRoute()` hook](/onBeforeRoute), we strongly recommend against doing so.

If you want a feature provided by Vue Router or React Router that vite-plugin-ssr is missing, then open a new feature request.
