> Defining `onBeforeRender()` in `.page.js` only works when using Client Routing.

Usually, we define [`onBeforeRender()` hooks in `.page.server.js`](/onBeforeRender)
but, if we use [Client Routing](/useClientRouter),
then we have the option to define `onBeforeRender()` in `.page.js` instead.

When defined in `.page.server.js` the `onBeforeRender()` hook is always loaded & executed in Node.js,
whereas if we define it in `.page.js` then `onBeforeRender()` is also loaded & executed in the browser:
for the first page the user visits `onBeforeRender()` is called in Node.js
while for any subsequent page navigation `onBeforeRender()` is called in the browser.

Examples:
- <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/star-wars/movie/index.page.tsx' />
- <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/star-wars/movie/index.page.vue' />

## Recommendation

When defined in `.page.js`, we need to make sure that `onBeforeRender()` is isomorphic: it needs to be able to run in Node.js as well as in the browser.
That's why, in general, we recommend defining the `onBeforeRender()` hook in `.page.server.js` since it's easier to write code that only runs
in Node.js.
That said, if we want to minimize requests made to our Node.js server, then we may want to define `onBeforeRender()` in `.page.js`.

## Server Routing

If we use [Server Routing](/SR-vs-CR#server-routing) we shouldn't define `onBeforeRender()` in `.page.js`
(the browser loads `onBeforeRender()` but never calls it). We can only define [`onBeforeRender()` in `.page.server.js`](/onBeforeRender).
