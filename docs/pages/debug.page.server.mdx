## vite-plugin-ssr

To use `vite-plugin-ssr`'s debug logs:

```shell
# Inspect the routing
DEBUG=vps:routing npm run dev
# Inspect what `.page.js` files are found and how they are treated
DEBUG=vps:pageFiles npm run dev
# Inspect HTTP Streaming
DEBUG=vps:stream npm run dev
# Inspect errors
DEBUG=vps:error npm run dev
# Inspect logs
DEBUG=vps:log npm run dev
# Combination
DEBUG=vps:log,vps:error,vps:stream npm run dev
```

> These debug logs allow you to understand how `vite-plugin-ssr` thinks of your app. For example, to figure out why your app returns a `404`, use `vps:routing` and `vps:pageFiles`.

There are more debug logs (`vps:glob`, `vps:extractAssets`, ...) but these aren't user friendly as they are meant for vite-plugin-ssr maintainers.

> If you want more debug logs, add a comment at [#249](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/249).

## Vite

To enable Vite's debug logs, set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `vite:*`.

```shell
$ DEBUG=vite:* npm run dev
```

If you have a problem with Vite, we recommend to consider injecting a bunch of `console.log()` inside `node_modules/vite/dist/**/*.js` in order to inspect what's going on.

> It may sound scary to dig into Vite's source code, but it's sometimes quicker to find the root cause of your problem than treating Vite as a black box. Also:
> - It's more interesting. (Vite's source code is well written and pleasurable to read.)
> - You may end up being able to do a Vite PR solving your problem (while helping the whole community!). (If you open a Vite PR, feel free to reach out to `vite-plugin-ssr` maintainers to get your PR merged quicker.)

> Instead of:
> ```bash
> $ git clone git@github.com:vitejs/vite
> $ cd vite/pacakges/vite/
> $ pnpm install
> $ pnpm run dev
> $ cd ../../../my-app/
> $ npm link ../vite/packages/vite/
> ```
> We recommend to:
> - Browse the source code of `$ git clone git@github.com:vitejs/vite`.
> - But, for an increased feedback loop, inject `console.log()` directly inside `my-app/node_modules/vite/dist/**/*.js`.
