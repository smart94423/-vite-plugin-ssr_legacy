Many npm packages contain invalid code which make Node.js crash.

See [solution](#solution).

The most notable issues are invalid [ESM](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/03/es-modules-a-cartoon-deep-dive/) and invalid CSS imports, see errors down below.

> We tried to convince Node.js/npm to address the issue but without success: [npm/rfcs#665](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/issues/665).


## Errors

```
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
```
```
(node:30335) Warning: To load an ES module, set "type": "module" in the package.json or use the .mjs extension.

> Node.js's message `set "type": "module" in package.json or use the .mjs extension` is misleading because it means the library's `node_modules/some-library/package.json`, not our `package.json`. It's not really actionable (unless we patch the library, e.g. with [pnpm.packageExtensions](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmpackageextensions) or [pnpm patch](https://pnpm.io/cli/patch)).

```
import { SomeImport } from "some-library";
         ^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Named export 'SomeImport' not found. The requested module 'some-library' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.
CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:

import pkg from 'some-library';
const { SomeImport } = pkg;

> The workaround proposed by Node.js often doesn't work. (Because, while the server-side imports CJS which always includes a default export, the browser-side imports ESM which usually doesn't have a default export.)

> The error is usually thrown when the library's ESM code contains `import './some-file'`. (It should be `import './some-file.js'` instead, as imports in ESM code are required to include the file extension.)

Another common problem is code importing CSS which also makes Node.js crash:

```
Error: ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION .css node_modules/some-library/dist/main.css
    at someFunction (node_modules/some-library/dist/main.js)
    at nextLoad (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:163:28)
    at ESMLoader.load (node:internal/modules/esm/loader:605:26)
```


## Solution

The workaround is to add npm packages containing invalid code to [`vite.config.js > ssr.noExternal`](https://vitejs.dev/config/ssr-options.html#ssr-noexternal).

```js
// vite.config.js

export default {
  ssr: {
    // Add npm packages containing invalid code here
    noExternal: ['some-library']
  }
}
```

> The reason why many npm packages contain erronous code is because frameworks like Next.js always transpile npm packages. (Whereas Vite lets Node.js directly execute npm packages in order to greatly improve dev performance: Vite transpiles only what is strictly needed). Where Next.js is permissive and is able to process invalid code, Node.js is strict and crashes upon invalid code. By adding npm packages to [`vite.config.js > ssr.noExternal`](https://vitejs.dev/config/ssr-options.html#ssr-noexternal) we replicate the behavior of frameworks like Next.js.

<Note type="warning">While using `vite.config.js > ssr.noExternal` fixes the problem, we recommend to contact the npm package author. For example: [aws-amplify/amplify-ui#3155](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ui/issues/3155). Vite is fast because it transpiles only what is strictly needed. To preserve Vite's speed, library authors should ship valid code.</Note>
