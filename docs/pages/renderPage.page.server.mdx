import { RepoLink, Link } from '@brillout/docpress'

Environment: server.

We use `renderPage()` in order to server-side render our pages.

> If we <Link text="pre-render" href="/pre-rendering" /> all our pages then we can omit using `renderPage()`. (We still need `renderPage()` for development, but we can use Vite's development server as vite-plugin-ssr automatically embeds `renderPage()` into it.)

```js
// server.js

// In this example we use Express.js but we could use any other server framework
import express from 'express'
import { renderPage } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/server'

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
const root = `${__dirname}/..`

startServer()

async function startServer() {
  const app = express()

  if (isProduction) {
    app.use(express.static(`${root}/${outDir}/client`))
  } else {
    // Instantiate Vite's development server and integrate its middleware to our server.
    // ⚠️ We should instantiate it *only* in development. (It isn't needed in production
    // and would unnecessarily bloat our server in production.)
    const vite = await import('vite')
    const viteDevMiddleware = (await vite.createServer({
      root,
      server: { middlewareMode: true }
    })).middlewares
    app.use(viteDevMiddleware)
  }

  app.get('*', async (req, res, next) => {
    const pageContextInit = { urlOriginal: req.originalUrl }
    const pageContext = await renderPage(pageContextInit)
    if (pageContext.httpResponse === null) return next()
    const { body, statusCode, contentType } = pageContext.httpResponse
    res.status(statusCode).type(contentType).send(body)
  })

  const port = 3000
  app.listen(port)
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`)
}
```

- `pageContext.httpResponse.statusCode` is either `200`, `404`, or `500`.
- `pageContext.httpResponse.contentType` is either `text/html;charset=utf-8` or `application/json`. (The `Content-Type` is `application/json` when <Link text="Client Routing" href="/client-routing" /> fetches the `pageContext` of the newly navigated page.)
- `pageContext.httpResponse.body` is the HTML string returned by the <Link text={<><code>render()</code> hook</>} href="/render" /> with additional `<script>` and `<style>` tags automatically injected by `vite-plugin-ssr`.
- `pageContext.httpResponse` is `null` if:
   - An error occurs while rendering the page and you didn't create an `_error.page.js` file.
   - An error occurs while rendering `_error.page.js`.
   - The URL is skipped: `vite-plugin-ssr` doesn't render certain URLs. (E.g. `pageContext.urlOriginal === '/favicon.ico'` because browsers automatically make favicon requests.)

`renderPage()` doesn't depend on Node.js and we can use `renderPage()` (and therefore embed vite-plugin-ssr) anywhere:
 - Any server environment (Express.js, HatTip, Deno, Fastify, Vite's development server, Node.js's HTTP server, ...)
 - Any deployment provider (AWS, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, ...)


## Examples

 - <RepoLink text='With JavaScript' path='/boilerplates/boilerplate-vue/server/index.js' />
 - <RepoLink text='With TypeScript' path='/boilerplates/boilerplate-vue-ts/server/index.ts' />


## `NODE_ENV`

We recommend the following.

In development:
- Don't set `process.env.NODE_ENV`, or set it to one of the following values: `['development', 'dev', '', undefined]`.
- Instantiate the Vite dev server, and add its middleware to your server as shown in the example code snippet above.

In production (and staging):
- Set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to a value different than `['development', 'dev', '', undefined]`, for example `'production'` or `'staging'`.
- Don't instantiate the Vite dev server: it isn't needed in production and would unnecessarily bloat your server in production.

> `process.env.NODE_ENV` is a convention to tell libraries whether your app is running in production or development:

> While the convention was introduced by Node.js, it's used by libraries regardless whether you use Node.js or not. That's why we recommend to set `process.env.NODE_ENV` in Edge environments as well.

Vite-plugin-ssr shows a warning if you don't respect the recommendation:

```
[vite-plugin-ssr][Warning] Vite's development server was instantiated while the environment
is set to be a production environment by `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'` which is
contradictory.
```
```
[vite-plugin-ssr][Warning] Vite's development server wasn't instantiated while the environment
is set to be a development environment by `process.env.NODE_ENV === undefined` which is
contradictory.
```
