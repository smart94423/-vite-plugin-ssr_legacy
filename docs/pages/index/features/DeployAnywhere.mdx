### It's just a middleware

From an architectural point of view, `vite-plugin-ssr` is just a server middleware.

<ServerMiddleware />

### Pre-rendering (aka SSG)

You can also pre-render your app to remove the need for a production Node.js server and deploy to any static host
(Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Netlify, ...).

<PrerenderPreview />

### Cloudflare Workers + `vite-plugin-ssr` = <Emoji name="red-heart" />

Thanks to `vite-plugin-ssr`'s lean architecture, your app is much less limited by Cloudflare Workers's 1MB source code size limit.

`vite-plugin-ssr` has been designed with Cloudflare Workers in mind, for example:
 - Supports HTML Streaming with Cloudflare Workers
 - Dev with Vite + Express.js, deploy to Cloudflare Workers
