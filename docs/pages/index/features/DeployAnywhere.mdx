### It's just a middleware

From an architectural point of view, `vite-plugin-ssr` is just a server middleware.

### Pre-rendering (aka SSG)

You can also pre-render your app to remove the need for a production Node.js server and deploy to any static host
(Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Netlify, ...).

### Cloudflare Workers + `vite-plugin-ssr` = <Emoji name="red-heart" />

Thanks to `vite-plugin-ssr`'s lean architecture, your app is much less limited by Cloudflare Workers's 1MB bundle size limit.

In general, `vite-plugin-ssr` has been designed with Cloudflare Workers in mind, for example:
 - You can dev with Vite + Express.js for lightning fast HMR & dev start, while bundling your worker code for production with Cloudflare Workers's webpack bundler
 - `vite-plugin-ssr` supports Cloudflare Workers's HTML Streaming feature
