### It's just a middleware

<JustAMiddleware />

### Pre-rendering (aka SSG)

You can also pre-render your app to remove the need for a production Node.js server and deploy to any static host
(Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Netlify, ...).

<PrerenderPreview />

<h3>Cloudflare Workers + <code>vite-plugin-ssr</code> = <Emoji name="red-heart" /></h3>

Thanks to `vite-plugin-ssr`'s lean architecture, your app is much less limited by Cloudflare Workers's 1MB bundle size limit.
