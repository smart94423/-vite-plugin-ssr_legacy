### Fast HMR

Blazing fast Hot Module Replacement powered by Vite <Emoji name="high-voltage" />. It
stays fast as you scale (thanks to Vite's novel lazy-transpiling approach).

### Routing

Pages are automatically routed:
```
FILESYSTEM                  URL
pages/index.page.js         /
pages/about.page.js         /about
pages/faq/index.page.js     /faq
```

You can also use so-called *Route Strings* and *Route Functions*.
```js
// Route String — for parameterized routes
export default '/movie/:movieId'

// Route Function — for full flexibility
export default ({ url, ...pageContext }) => url==='/admin' && pageContext.isAdmin
```

You can choose between:

- Client Routing for a faster page navigation. (DOM mutation upon page navigation.)
- Server Routing for a simpler app architecture. (Full HTML reload upon page navigation.)

### Render Modes (SSR, SPA, SSG, HTML-only)

For each page, you can choose between:
 - SSR: the page's HTML is rendered at request-time.
 - SSG: the page's HTML is pre-rendered at build-time.
 - SPA: the page is not rendered to HTML; it's only loaded & rendered in the browser.
 - HTML-only: the page is rendered only to HTML with zero/minimal browser-side JavaScript.

For example,
you can render an admin panel as an SPA,
while rendering marketing pages only to HTML
with zero browser-side JavaScript.

`https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` is HTML-only and loads only few KBs of JavaScript (implementing the few bits of interactivity such as the collapsibility of this `LEARN MORE` section).
