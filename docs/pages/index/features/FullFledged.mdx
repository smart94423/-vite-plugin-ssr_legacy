### HMR

Hot Module Replacement powered by Vite that is and stays fast as we scale.

### Routing
Pages are automatically routed:
```
FILESYSTEM                  URL
pages/index.page.js         /
pages/about.page.js         /about
pages/faq/index.page.js     /faq
```

We can also define advanced routing:
```js
// We can define parameters with Route Strings
export default '/movie/:movieId'

// We can also use Route Functions for full flexibility
export default ({ url, ...pageContext }) => url==='/admin' && pageContext.isAdmin
```

We can choose between:

- Client-side Routing: instead of doing a full page reload, only minimal DOM changes are applied, leading to page
  transitions that are faster and that can be animated.
- Server-side Routing: the "old school way" which is to completely discard the old page and load the new page entirely.
  While it is slightly slower, it leads to a simpler application architecture.

### SSR, SPA, HTML-first

We can create:
- SSR pages.
- SPA pages (aka MPA).
- HTML-first pages (zero/minimal browser-side JavaScript).

For example, we can render an admin panel as SPA while rendering marketing pages to HTML-first.
