### Fast HMR

Blazing fast Hot Module Replacement powered by Vite <Emoji name="high-voltage" />. It
stays fast as you scale (thanks to Vite's novel lazy-transpiling approach).

### Routing
Pages are automatically routed:
```
FILESYSTEM                  URL
pages/index.page.js         /
pages/about.page.js         /about
pages/faq/index.page.js     /faq
```

You can also use so-called *Route Strings* and *Route Functions*.
```js
// Route Strings for parameterized routes
export default '/movie/:movieId'

// Route Functions for full flexibility
export default ({ url, ...pageContext }) => url==='/admin' && pageContext.isAdmin
```

You can choose between:

- Client-side Routing: instead of doing a full page reload, only minimal DOM changes are applied, leading to faster page
  transitions.
- Server-side Routing: the "old school way" which is to completely discard the old page and to completely load the new page.
  While it is slightly slower, it leads to a simpler architecture.

### SSR, SPA & HTML-first

You can create:
- SSR pages.
- SPA pages (aka MPA).
- HTML-first pages (zero/minimal browser-side JavaScript).

For example, you can render an admin panel as SPA while rendering marketing pages to HTML-first.
