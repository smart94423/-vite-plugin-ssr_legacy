In some situations we do not want to pre-render a page.
For example a news page that displays the latest news fetched from a database should be rendered at request-time and certainly not at build-time.

We can use `.page.server.js#noNoPrerender` to tell `vite-plugin-ssr` to skip a page from pre-rendering.

```js
// news.page.server.js

export const doNotPrerender = true
```
