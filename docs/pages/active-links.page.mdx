> **What are active links?** It's the practice of highlighting the current page in the navigation's list of pages.
> For example, we can see this page "Routing" highlighted in gray in the navgation sidebar on the left of this website; the navigation link pointing to this page is said to be "active".

To implement active links we provide the current URL `pageContext.urlPathname` to our link component, so that our component can check whether the link is active `const isActive = href===urlPathname` and then add a CSS class `<a class="is-active">` accordingly.

We don't use `window.location.pathname` as it's not available on the server-side (unless we [render our page as an SPA](/SPA-vs-SSR-vs-HTML)).

To make `pageContext.urlPathname` available to our link component:
 - We make `pageContext.urlPathname` available on the client-side by adding `'urlPathname'` to `passToClient`.
   (See [Data Fetching Guide](/data-fetching) for an introduction about `passToClient`.
   If we [render our page to HML-only](/SPA-vs-SSR-vs-HTML) then we can skip this.)
 - We make `pageContext.urlPathname` available to the whole component tree so that our link component can access it.
   (See [Access `pageContext` anywhere](/pageContext-anywhere).)
