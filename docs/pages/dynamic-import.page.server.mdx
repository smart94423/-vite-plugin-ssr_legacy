We can use `import()` to lazily load components:

```diff
- import SomeComponent from 'some-component'
+ const { SomeComponent } = await import('some-component')
```

> Vite automatically code-splits at `import()` and the code of `some-component` is not included in the initial JavaScript browser-side bundle:
> the code is loaded only if/when `import('some-component')` is executed.

There are two use cases for using `import()` to dynamically import components:
 - **Performance**. The idea here is to defer loading heavy components (e.g. a heavy interactive map), so that the user can already interact with our page before the browser has loaded that heavy component.
 - **Client-side only components**. Some components don't work in Node.js; we use `import()` to load & render them only on the client-side.
   > UI Frameworks usually don't execute `import()` upon SSR (this is, for example, the case with React and Vue). This means that compoments imported with `import()` are never loaded on the server-side.

UI frameworks usually have built-in support for dynamically loading components:

 - [Vue 3 Docs > Async Components](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/component-dynamic-async.html#async-components)
 - [Vue 2 Docs > Async Components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-dynamic-async.html)


## React Example

```jsx
// pages/pick-location.page.jsx

import React from 'react'

export function Page() {
  // Users can see and interact with the "Please pick a location" button
  // before the browser loads the code of <SomeHeavyMapComponent>.
  return <>
    <button>Please pick a location</button>
    <Map />
  </>
}

function Map() {
  // We lazy-load the code of `<SomeHeavyMapComponent>`
  const SomeHeavyMapComponent = React.lazy(() => import('some-heavy-map-component'))
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={'Loading Map...'}>
      <SomeHeavyMapComponent />
    </React.Suspense>
  )
}
```
