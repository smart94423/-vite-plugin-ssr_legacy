## What is pre-rendering?

Pre-rendering means to render the HTML of all our pages at build-time.
Normally, the HTML of a page is rendered at request-time
(when the user navigates to that page). But,
with pre-rendering, the HTML of a page is rendered at build-time instead (when we call `$ vite build`).

Thanks to pre-rendering, we don't need a Node.js server: our app consists only of static assets (HTML, JS, CSS, images, ...)
and we can deploy these static assets to a so-called "static host" such as [GitHub Pages](/github-pages), [Cloudflare Pages](/cloudflare-pages), or [Netlify](/netlify).
If we don't use pre-rendering, then we need a Node.js server to be able to dynamically render our pages' HTML at request-time.

## How to pre-render

To pre-render our pages, we use the [CLI command `prerender`](/command-prerender) at the end of the build:
 - npm: `$ npx vite build && npx vite build --ssr && npx vite-plugin-ssr prerender`.
 - Yarn: `$ yarn vite build && yarn vite build --ssr && yarn vite-plugin-ssr prerender`.

The generated static assets are available at `dist/client/`.

> The only difference between using [`$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender`](/command-prerender) and using [`createPageRenderer()`](/createPageRenderer) is *when* the HTML is rendered ([`render()`](/render)/`onBeforeRender()` hooks called at build-time VS request-time); client-side code is always executed at request-time in the user's browser.

For pages with a parameterized route (e.g. `/movie/:movieId`), we have to use the [`prerender()` hook](/prerender) in order to provide a list of URLs that are to be pre-rendered.

We can also use the `prerender()` hook to accelerate the pre-rendering process as it allows us to prefetch data for multiple pages at once.

We can skip pre-rendering for certain pages by using [`.page.server.js#doNotPrerender`](/doNotPrerender).

## Examples

React Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/package.json' /> (see npm scripts using the CLI command <code>$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender</code> and static serving <code>dist/client/</code>)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/hello/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/star-wars/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)

Vue Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/package.json' /> (see npm scripts using the CLI command <code>$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender</code> and static serving <code>dist/client/</code>)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/hello/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/star-wars/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)

## Should I pre-render?

We should use pre-rendering whenever we can.
Because pre-rendering removes the need for a Node.js server which makes deployement an order of magnitude easier (and it's also more performant as HTML isn't re-generated on every request).

The problem is that pre-rendering cannot be used for every kind of website. So the question here is: for what kind of websites can pre-rendering be used?

Pre-rendering cannot be used for websites that have highly dynamic content. For example, a social site such as Hacker News or Reddit has highly dynamic content: the content changes every time a user posts a new link or writes a new comment. For such highly dynamic content, we cannot use pre-rendering because the HTML is stuck at build-time and we cannot re-build the entire website every time there is new content.

Pre-rendering works for websites with content that changes only few times a day. For example, `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` is updated only occasionally, and we can re-build the entire `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` website every time we change its content. Pre-rendering allows us to deploy `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` to GitHub Pages which is an order of magnitude easier (and more performant) than using a Node.js server.
