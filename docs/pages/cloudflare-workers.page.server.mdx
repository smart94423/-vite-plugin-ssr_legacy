## Basics

Cloudflare Workers requires our entire worker code to be bundled into a single file.

> Cloudflare uses the term "worker code" to denote server code that is run on its edge infrastructure.

We recommend using [wrangler v2](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2) (which uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) under the hood).


## Extend 1MB limit

The bundle size of our worker should not exceed 1MB, but we can request sizes of up to 100MB and beyond:
 - [Cloudflare Workers > Larger Scripts](https://www.cloudflare.com/larger-scripts-on-workers-early-access/)
 - [Cloudflare Workers > Limits > Worker Size](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-size)


## Cloudflare Pages

We can also use [Cloudflare Pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/) to deploy our `vite-plugin-ssr` app.

To deploy our SSR worker, we use a [Cloudflare Pages Function](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/).

<Note type="warning">Cloudflare Pages Functions is [in beta](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/).</Note>

Example:
 - [github.com/Immortalin/vite-plugin-ssr-cloudflare-pages-demo](https://github.com/Immortalin/vite-plugin-ssr-cloudflare-pages-demo)

## Development

For a significantly faster development experience, we recommend, whenever possible, using Vite's development server instead of wrangler (or an Express.js server).

This means:
 - We skip `wrangler` / Cloudflare Workers altogether while developing our app.
 - We use `wrangler dev` to preview our worker.
 - We use `wrangler publish` to deploy our worker to Cloudflare Workers.

See the setup of the [examples](#examples).


## Universal `fetch()`

When using Node.js for development and Cloudflare Workers for production, we may need a `fetch()` function that works in both environments.

But libraries such as `node-fetch` or `cross-fetch` usually don't work with Cloudflare Workers.

What we can do is to define a fetch function at `pageContext.fetch` that works in all environments.
The trick is to add a different `fetch()` implementation to `pageContextInit` at <Link text={<code>renderPage(pageContextInit)</code>} href="/renderPage" />.

Example: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers-react-full#universal-fetch' />.
