## Vite

To enable Vite's debug logs, we set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `vite:*`.

```shell
$ DEBUG=vite* npm run dev
```
> If you want the same functionality for `vite-plugin-ssr`, upvote and/or comment the feature request [#249](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/249).

We recommend directly inspecting Vite's built source code in `node_modules/vite/`, for example by injecting `console.log()` calls to bisect down the bug.

> It may sound scary to dig into Vite's source code, but it's often a faster (and a more interesting) way to find the root cause of problems. Vite's source code is well written and pleasurable to read. It also get's you closer to actually being able to fix the problem. If you open a Vite PR, feel free to reach out to the `vite-plugin-ssr` maintainers to get your PR merged quicker.
