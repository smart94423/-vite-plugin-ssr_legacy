For each page, we can choose:
 - Whether the page is rendered to HTML.
 - When the page is rendered to HTML.
 - Whether the page is rendered(/hydrated) in the browser.

In other words, we can use any render mode:
 - SSR: the page is rendered to HTML and also rendered(/hydrated) in the browser-side.
 - SSG (aka pre-rendering): the page is rendered to HTML at build-time.
 - SPA (aka MPA): the page is not rendered to HTML; it's only rendered in the browser.
 - HTML-only: the the page is rendered only to HTML; it's not rendered in the browser and has zero/minimal browser-side JavaScript.

For example, we can render an admin panel as SPA while rendering marketing pages to HTML-only.

> The `vite-plugin-ssr` boilerplates do SSR by default, which is a sensible default that works for most apps.
> **Being aware of our options is important**:
> choosing another render mode than SSR can play an important role in order to keep our app architecture simple and therefore leading to a substantial increase in development speed. It can also lead to substantial performance increase but for most apps SSR is performant enough and we should **spend time fine-tuning performance only if needed**.

## HTML-only

We can choose HTML-only for pages with no/few interactivity. (Technically speaking: if the page has no/few stateful components.)

The page then has zero/little browser-side JavaScript.

Examples:
 - Blog
 - Portfolio/homepage
 - Marketing pages
 - Software Documentation (e.g. `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com`)

For the few bits of interactivity (such as an image carousel or a collapsible section),
the page can load a couple of vanilla browser-side JavaScript libraries to surgically implement these few bits of interactivity. (Instead of loading & rendering the whole page and view framework in the browser).
This what `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` does: if you inspect the browser-side JavaScript of this page, you'll see only around 1-2KB of JavaScript.

To render a page to HTML-only, we simply define an empty `.page.client.js`:

```js
// .page.client.js
// Environment: Browser

// We leave this empty; there is no browser-side JavaScript.

// We can still include CSS
import './path/to/some.css'
```

> We still need to import all static assets in `.page.client.js`, see [#171](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/171).

## SSG

Pre-rendering (aka SSG) means to render the page's HTML at build-time instead of request-time.

We should use pre-rendering whenever we can, as it allows us to deploy our app to a Static Host.

For example, `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` is pre-rendered and deployed to [GitHub Pages](/github-pages).

More infos at: [Guides > Pre-rendering](/pre-rendering).

## Content- VS interactive-centric

To decided between SSR and SPA, we need to discriminate between two types of apps:
 - *Content-centric*: the value of the page is mostly about the content (e.g. a newspaper or a blog).
 - *Interactive-centric*: the value of the page is mostly about interaction (e.g. a to-do list manager or an online image editor).

## SPA

SPA means that the page is only loaded & rendered in the browser.

We can choose to render a page to SPA if:
 - The page is (highly) interactive (otherwise we would render it to HTML-only).
 - The page is not [content-centric](#content-vs-interactive-centric).

More broadly, if we don't need SEO (e.g. the page doesn't need to appear on Google) nor mobile performance (e.g. users usually don't go to the page with a mobile device), then we should consider SPA. For example, an admin panel should be an SPA (even if it's content-centric).

SPA has two major advantages:
 - It doesn't enforce the usage of a production Node.js server. (Whereas SSR does.)
 - The `.page.js` code doesn't need to be able to run in Node.js. (For example, SPA is the only option for libraries that don't work with SSR. Although, luckily, most libraries have support/workarounds for SSR.)

To render a page as SPA, we simply render static HTML:

```js
// .page.server.js
// Environment: Node.js

import { escapeInject } from 'vite-plugin-ssr'

export function render() {
  // `div#app-root` is empty; the HTML is static.
  return escapeInject`<html>
    <head>
      <title>My Website</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="app-root"/>
    </body>
  </html>`
}
```

## SSR

SSR means that our page is rendered to HTML as well as as rendered(/hydrated) in the browser.

It is the most powerful mode as it enables:
 - Highly interactive UIs.
 - SEO (the page needs to rank high on Google).
 - Higher mobile performance.

SSR considerably improves mobile performance, as the content rendered to HTML can already be shown to the user before the browser-side JavaScript starts loading on the user's mobile device.
(Loading & executing JavaScript is usually very slow on mobile devices.)

For example, SSR is needed for a social news website or interactive marketing pages. (They are interactive and need SEO and higher mobile performance.)

For pages that are not [content-centric](#content-vs-interactive-centric) (e.g. a to-do list app), we should consider SPA instead of SSR.
