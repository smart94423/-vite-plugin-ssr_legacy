Users have successfully used vite-plugin-ssr with [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) in the past, the challenge was to make Vite's development server middleware work with Fastify. [Vite-plugin-ssr's server middleware](/renderPage) shouldn't be an issue.

Contribution welcome to create a Fastify example.
