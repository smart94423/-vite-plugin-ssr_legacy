For each page, we can choose:
 - Whether the page is rendered to HTML.
 - When the page is rendered to HTML (render-time VS build-time).
 - Whether the page is rendered(/hydrated) in the browser.

In other words, a page can use any render mode:
 - SSR: the page is rendered to HTML and also rendered (hydrated) in the browser-side. (The page is loaded both in Node.js and in the browser.)
 - SPA (aka MPA): the page is not rendered to HTML; it's only rendered in the browser. (The page is loaded only in browser.)
 - HTML-only: the page is rendered only to HTML; it's not rendered in the browser and has zero/minimal browser-side JavaScript. (The page is loaded only in Node.js.)
 - SSG (aka pre-rendering): the page is rendered to HTML at build-time.

For example, we can render an admin panel as SPA while rendering marketing pages to HTML-only.

> The `vite-plugin-ssr` boilerplates do SSR by default, which is a sensible default that works for most apps.


## SPA

SPA means that the page is only loaded & rendered in the browser.

We usually render a page as SPA if:
 - The page is (highly) interactive. (Otherwise we would render it to HTML-only.)
 - The page is not <Link text="content centric" href="/content-vs-interactive" />. (Otherwise we would use SSR because of SEO.)

More broadly,
if the page doesn't need SEO
(e.g. an Admin Panel doesn't need to appear in Google searches)
nor mobile performance
(e.g. the user is expected to use the Admin Panel on a desktop device),
then SPA is an option.

SPA has two major advantages:
 - It doesn't enforce the usage of a production Node.js server. (Whereas SSR does.)
 - The `.page.js` file doesn't need to be able to run in Node.js. (For example, SPA is the only option for libraries that don't work with SSR. Although, luckily, most libraries have support/workarounds for SSR.)

To render a page as SPA:
 1. We `export { Page }` in `.page.client.js` instead of `.page.js`.
 1. We adapt our `render()` hooks.

```js
// /pages/about.page.client.js
// Environment: Browser

// Usually `Page` is defined in `*.page.js` but for an SPA page
// we define `Page` in `*.page.client.js` instead.
export { Page }

function Page() {
  return <>
    <h1>SPA page</h1>
    <p>
      This page is rendered only on the browser-side. (It isn't rendered to HTML.)
    </p>
  </>
}
```

Example:
 - <RepoLink path="/examples/render-modes/pages/spa/index.page.client.jsx" />

If we only have SPA pages, we adapt our `render()` hooks like this:

```js
// /renderer/_default.page.server.js
// Environment: Node.js

import { escapeInject } from 'vite-plugin-ssr'

export function render() {
  // `div#root` is empty; the HTML is static.
  return escapeInject`<html>
    <body>
      <div id="root"></div>
    </body>
  </html>`
}
```

```js
// /renderer/_default.page.client.js
// Environment: Browser

import { renderToDom } from 'some-ui-framework'

export { render }

async function render(pageContext) {
  const { Page } = pageContext
  // UI frameworks usually have two methods, such as `renderToDom()` and `hydrateDom()`.
  // Note how we use `renderToDom()` and not `hydrateDom()`.
  await renderToDom(document.getElementById('root'), Page)
}
```

> See <Link href="/hydration" /> for understanding the difference between "rendering to the DOM" and "hydrating the DOM".

If we have both SPA and SSR pages, we adapt our `render()` hooks like this:

```js
// /renderer/_default.page.server.js
// Environment: Node.js

import { escapeInject, dangerouslySkipEscape } from 'vite-plugin-ssr'
import { renderToHtml } from 'some-ui-framework'

export function render(pageContext) {
  let pageHtml = ''
  if (pageContext.Page) {
    // For SSR pages
    pageHtml = renderToHtml(pageContext.Page)
  }
  // `div#root` is empty for SPA pages
  return escapeInject`<html>
    <body>
      <div id="root">${dangerouslySkipEscape(pageHtml)}</div>
    </body>
  </html>`
}
```

> SPA pages `export { Page }` in `.page.client.js` which means that `pageContext.Page` only exists on the browser-side (because `*.page.client.js` files are only loaded in the browser). Thus `pageContext.Page` is `undefined` in Node.js.
>
> SSR pages, in contrast, `export { Page }` in `.page.js` which means that `pageContext.Page` always exists (since `*.page.js` files are loaded in Node.js as well as in the browser).

```js
// /renderer/_default.page.client.js
// Environment: Browser

import { renderToDom, hydrateDom } from 'some-ui-framework'

export async function render(pageContext) {
  const { Page } = pageContext
  const rootDomElement = document.getElementById('root')
  if (
    // SPA pages don't have any hydration steps
    rootDomElement.innerHTML === '' ||
    // Page navigation of SSR pages also need to be fully rendered (if we use Client Routing)
    !pageContext.isHydration
  ) {
    await renderToDom(rootDomElement, Page)
  } else {
    // The first render of SSR pages is a hydration
    await renderToDom(Page)
  }
}
```

Example:
 - <RepoLink path="/examples/render-modes/renderer/_default.page.server.jsx" />
 - <RepoLink path="/examples/render-modes/renderer/_default.page.client.jsx" />
 - <RepoLink path="/examples/render-modes/pages/spa/index.page.client.jsx" />
 - <RepoLink path="/examples/render-modes/pages/ssr/index.page.jsx" />


## SSR

SSR means that our page is rendered to HTML as well as as rendered (hydrated) in the browser.

It is the most capable mode as it enables:
 - Highly interactive UIs.
 - SEO. (High ranking on Google.)
 - Improved mobile performance.

SSR improves mobile performance in the sense that the page's content is rendered to HTML and can already be shown to the user before the browser-side JavaScript even starts loading.
(Loading & executing JavaScript is usually very slow on mobile.)

For example, social news websites need SSR. (They are interactive while needing both SEO and mobile performance.)

For pages that are not <Link text="content centric" href="/content-vs-interactive" /> (e.g. a to-do list app), we can consider SPA instead of SSR.


## SSG (aka pre-rendering)

Pre-rendering (aka SSG) means to render the page's HTML at build-time instead of request-time.

We should use pre-rendering whenever we can, as it allows us to deploy our app to a Static Host.

For example, `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` is pre-rendered and deployed to [GitHub Pages](/github-pages).

See [Guides > Pre-rendering](/pre-rendering).


## HTML-only

We can choose HTML-only for pages with no/little interactivity. (Technically speaking: the page has no/few stateful components.)

The page then has zero/little browser-side JavaScript.

Examples:
 - Blog
 - Portfolio/homepage
 - Marketing pages
 - Software Documentation (e.g. `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com`)

For the few bits of interactivity (such as an image carousel or a collapsible section),
the page can load a couple of vanilla browser-side JavaScript libraries to surgically implement these few bits of interactivity.
This is what `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` does: if we inspect the browser-side JavaScript of this page, we'll see only around 1-2KB of JavaScript.

To render a page to HTML-only:

 1. We `export { Page }` in `.page.server.js` instead of `.page.js`.
 1. We set <Link text={<code>includeAssetsImportedByServer</code>} href="/includeAssetsImportedByServer" /> to `true`.


```js
// /pages/about.page.server.js
// Environment: Browser

// Usually `Page` is defined in `*.page.js` but for HTML-only we
// define `Page` in `*.page.server.js` instead.
export { Page }

function Page() {
  return <>
    <h1>HTML-only page</h1>
    <p>
      This page is rendered only to HTML. (It's not loaded/rendered in the browser-side.)
    </p>
  </>
}
```

```js
// vite.config.js

import { ssr } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [
    ssr({
      includeAssetsImportedByServer: true
    })
  ]
}
```
