Vite-plugin-ssr provides an architecture that is both flexible and robust.

## Do-one-thing-do-it-well

Vite-plugin-ssr's architecture has been designed with meticulous care and follows what we call a "do-one-thing-do-it-well architecture": vite-plugin-ssr focuses on being an excellent frontend framework while not interfering with the rest of your stack.

With vite-plugin-ssr, you can choose:
 - Any UI framework (React/Vue/Solid/...)
 - Any server (Express.js, Deno, HatTip, ...)
 - Any deployment (AWS, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, ...)

With vite-plugin-ssr, your application's architecture is composed of loosely coupled core constituents with a clear separation of concerns.

We believe that these core constituents should be mostly independent. For more freedom for the user and, also, for fostering a vibrant ecosystem with an innovation-driven competition delivering high-quality tools for the users.


## `onRenderHtml()` & `onRenderClient()`

Packages such as `vike-react`, `vike-vue` and `vike-solid` integrate UI frameworks so that you don't have to write any integration code.

But, if you want, instead of using a `vike-*` package you can use the hooks `onRenderHtml()` and `onRenderClient()` for complete control over how pages are rendered.

Not only can you manually integrate with any UI framework you want and however you want, you can also deeply integrate with your favorite data fetching tools. For example, you can integrate with Relay in ways that aren't possible with other frameworks.

```js
// /renderer/+onRenderHtml.js
// Environment: server

export default onRenderHtml

import { renderToHtml } from 'some-ui-framework'
import { escapeInject, dangerouslySkipEscape } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/server'

async function onRenderHtml(pageContext) {
  const { Page } = pageContext
  const pageHtml = await renderToHtml(Page)
  return escapeInject`<!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My VPS app</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="root">${dangerouslySkipEscape(pageHtml)}</div>
      </body>
    </html>`
}
```

```js
// /renderer/+onRenderClient.js
// Environment: browser

export default onRenderClient

import { renderToDom } from 'some-ui-framework'

async function onRenderClient(pageContext) {
  const { Page } = pageContext
  await renderToDom(Page, document.getElementById('#root'))
}
```


## `renderPage()`

Vite-plugin-ssr can easily be embedded into any server architecture and any deployment strategy.
