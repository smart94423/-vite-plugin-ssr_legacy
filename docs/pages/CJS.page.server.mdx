While you can use vite-plugin-ssr with
[CJS code](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules-commonjs-modules:~:text=CommonJS%20modules%20are%20the%20original%20way%20to%20package%20JavaScript%20code%20for%20Node.js.%20Node.js%20also%20supports%20the%20ECMAScript%20modules%20standard%20used%20by%20browsers%20and%20other%20JavaScript%20runtimes.),
we recommend writing
[ESM code](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#modules-ecmascript-modules:~:text=ECMAScript%20modules%20are%20the%20official%20standard%20format%20to%20package%20JavaScript%20code%20for%20reuse.%20Modules%20are%20defined%20using%20a%20variety%20of%20import%20and%20export%20statements.)
instead.

> The code you write that is processed by Vite is already ESM. But [some of your server code may not be processed by Vite](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/562) and may be CJS.

If you get the following warning:

```
[vite-plugin-ssr][Warning] We recommend setting package.json#type to "module" (and therefore
writing ESM code instead of CJS code)
```

Then, in order to remove the warning, add this to your `package.json`:

```json5
// package.json
{
   // ...
   type: "module"
}
```

This [makes Node.js treat all .js files as ESM](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v13.x/api/esm.html#esm_package_json_type_field:~:text=Files%20ending%20with%20.js%20will%20be%20loaded%20as%20ES%20modules%20when%20the%20nearest%20parent%20package.json%20file%20contains%20a%20top%2Dlevel%20field%20%22type%22%20with%20a%20value%20of%20%22module%22.).

This means that, if you have .js files written in CJS, then you'll have to migrate them to ESM. For example:

```js
-// CJS code
-const express = require('express')
-const { renderPage } = require('vite-plugin-ssr/server')
+// ESM code
+import express from 'express'
+import { renderPage } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/server'
```

> An escape hatch is to use [the `.cjs` and `.mjs` file extensions](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#enabling:~:text=Authors%20can%20tell%20Node.js%20to%20use%20the%20ECMAScript%20modules%20loader%20via%20the%20.mjs%20file%20extension), enabling you to determine/change the module system on a file-by-file basis regardless of whether `package.json#type` is set to `"module"` or `"commonjs"`.

> You still want to use CJS? Let us know why and we'll create a new `config.disableCJSWarning`.
