## Npm packages containing invalid code

Vite purposely doesn't transpile server-side code but lets your Node.js server directly execute npm packages (in order to improve DX speed).

But some npm packages contain invalid JavaScript code and you need to add them to `vite.config.js > ssr.noExternal`, see <Link href="/broken-npm-package#solution" />.
