The `dist/server/importBuild.js` file enables bundlers to discover the entire dependency tree of our server-side code.

```js
// dist/server/importBuild.js

// Load this file if your server code is bundled. For example:
//  - Cloudflare Workers needs the entire worker code to be bundled into a single file.
//  - Vercel bundles serverless functions behind the scenes.

// The path of following dependencies are normally determined dynamically at run-time; this file
// makes these dependencies discoverable at build-time so that bundlers are able to determine
// the entire dependency tree.

const { pageFiles } = require("./pageFiles.js");
const clientManifest = require("../client/manifest.json");
const serverManifest = require("../server/manifest.json");
const { __private: { importBuild } } = require("vite-plugin-ssr");
importBuild({ pageFiles, clientManifest, serverManifest });
```

> `dist/server/importBuild.js` works with any bundler,
> which means that our server-side code can be bundled with any bundler.

The `dist/server/importBuild.js` file is generated by [`vite-plugin-import-build`](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-import-build).
