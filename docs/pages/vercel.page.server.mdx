Deploy `vite-plugin-ssr` to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).


## API Route

We can deploy our `vite-plugin-ssr` app to Vercel by
creating a Vercel API Route `api/ssr.js` that server-side renders our app.

Example: [github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel).

> Vercel runs our API Route `api/ssr.js` as a serverless function.
> See [Vercel Docs > Serverless Functions > Deploying](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions#deploying-serverless-functions).

Using such API Route is the recommended way. API Routes is a core Vercel feature: it's here to stay and, most importantly, stable. (Whereas Vercel's Build Output API is a fast moving target with frequent breaking changes.) Once we setup our server-side rendering API Route, we can safely expect it to work for the foreseeable future.


## vite-plugin-vercel

For a zero-config integration with [ISR](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration) support, we can use [`vite-plugin-vercel`](https://github.com/magne4000/vite-plugin-vercel).

If we use <Link text="partial pre-rendering" href="/prerender-config#partial" />, we can use `vite-plugin-vercel` to statically deploy our pre-rendered pages while dynamically serving our non-pre-rendered pages.


## Build Output API

For more flexibility and configuration options, we can use the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3).

Example: [github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel_build-output-api](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel_build-output-api).


## Data APIs (GraphQL, RESTful, RPC)

Vercel API Routes only work on Vercel's platform; we cannot run them locally.

This means that we need to integrate our data layer twice:
 1. Using Vercel's API Routes, for Vercel deployment.
 1. Using a local server (e.g. Express.js), for development.

This is usally easy to achieve as most data layer tools integrate using a single HTTP endpoint. For example:
 - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) integrates over a single HTTP endpoint `/graphql`.
 - [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com/) integrates over a single HTTP endpoint `/_telefunc`.

In other words, we add a data layer by:
 - Creating a new Vercel API Route, integrating that single endpoint.
 - Creating a new route to our local development server (e.g. Express.js), integrating that single endpoint.

> When using SSR, we recommend using [RPC instead of GraphQL](https://telefunc.com/RPC-vs-GraphQL-REST), which most of time leads to a drastic simplification and increased development speed.


## ISR

We can use Vercel's [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/next.js/incremental-static-regeneration) by using [vite-plugin-vercel](https://github.com/magne4000/vite-plugin-vercel), see [above](#vite-plugin-vercel).
