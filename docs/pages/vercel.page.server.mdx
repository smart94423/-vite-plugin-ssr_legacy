We can deploy `vite-plugin-ssr` to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) simply by using a Vercel API Route, or we can use `vite-plugin-vercel` if we want advanced Vercel features such as ISR and Edge Middleware.


## API Route

We can deploy our `vite-plugin-ssr` app to Vercel simply by creating a Vercel API Route `api/ssr.js` that server-side renders our app.

Example: [github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel).

<Warning>Make sure to properly set `OUTPUT DIRECTORY` in your Vercel dashboard, see the example's `readme.md` instructions.</Warning>

> Using a Vercel API Route is a sturdy way to deploy to Vercel as API Routes is a core Vercel feature: it's here to stay and, most importantly, stable. (Whereas Vercel's Build Output API is a moving target with occasional breaking changes.) Once we setup our server-side rendering API Route, we can expect it to work for the foreseeable future.


## vite-plugin-vercel

[`vite-plugin-vercel`](https://github.com/magne4000/vite-plugin-vercel) enables zero-configuration support for all Vercel features, including [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/incremental-static-regeneration/overview) and Edge Middleware.

If we <Link text="pre-render our pages only partially" href="/prerender-config#partial" />, we can also use `vite-plugin-vercel` to statically deploy our pre-rendered pages while dynamically serving our non-prerendered pages.

> Under the hood, `vite-plugin-vercel` uses Vercel's [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3).


## Build Output API

For maximum flexibility and configuration options, we can also directly use the [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3).

Example: [github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel_build-output-api](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr_vercel_build-output-api).


## Data APIs (GraphQL, RESTful, RPC)

Vercel API Routes only work on Vercel's platform; we cannot run them locally.

This means that we need to integrate our data layer twice:
 1. Using Vercel's API Routes, for Vercel deployment.
 1. Using a local server (e.g. Express.js), for development.

This is usally easy to achieve as most data layer tools integrate using a single HTTP endpoint. For example:
 - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) integrates over a single HTTP endpoint `/graphql`.
 - [Telefunc](https://telefunc.com/) integrates over a single HTTP endpoint `/_telefunc`.

In other words, we add a data layer by:
 - Creating a new Vercel API Route, integrating that single endpoint.
 - Creating a new route to our local development server (e.g. Express.js), integrating that single endpoint.

> When using SSR, we recommend using [RPC instead of GraphQL](https://telefunc.com/RPC-vs-GraphQL-REST), which most of time leads to a drastic simplification and increased development speed.
