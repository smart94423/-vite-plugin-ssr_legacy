## What is pre-rendering?

Pre-rendering means to render the HTML of all our pages at build-time.

Normally, the HTML of a page is rendered at request-time
(when the user navigates to that page) but,
if we using pre-rendering, the HTML of the page is rendered at build-time instead.

When using pre-rendering, we don't need a Node.js server: our app consists only of static assets (HTML, JS, CSS, images, ...)
and we can deploy these static assets to a so-called "static host" such as <Link href="/github-pages" text="GitHub Pages" />, [Cloudflare Pages](/cloudflare-pages), or [Netlify](/netlify).

If we don't use pre-rendering, then we need a Node.js production server (or a Node.js-like environment such as <Link href="/cloudflare-workers" text="Cloudflare Workers" /> or <Link href="/vercel" text="Vercel" />) in order to be able to dynamically render our pages' HTML at request-time.

> Tools that pre-render pages are commonly called <b>S</b>tatic-<b>S</b>ite <b>G</b>enerators (SSG).

## How to pre-render

To pre-render our pages, we use the CLI command <Link href="/command-prerender" text={<code>$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender</code>} /> after having run `$ vite build`.
 - npm: `$ npx vite build && npx vite build --ssr && npx vite-plugin-ssr prerender`.
 - Yarn: `$ yarn vite build && yarn vite build --ssr && yarn vite-plugin-ssr prerender`.

The generated static assets are then available at `dist/client/`.

For a page with a parameterized route (e.g. `/movie/:movieId`), we have to use the [`prerender()` hook](/prerender) in order to provide the list of URLs that are to be pre-rendered.

We can also use the `prerender()` hook to accelerate the pre-rendering build step.

React Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/package.json' /> (see npm scripts using the CLI command <code>$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender</code> and static serving <code>dist/client/</code>)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/hello/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/react-full/pages/star-wars/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)

Vue Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/package.json' /> (see npm scripts using the CLI command <code>$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender</code> and static serving <code>dist/client/</code>)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/hello/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/vue-full/pages/star-wars/index.page.server.ts' /> (see usage of the <code>prerender()</code> hook)


## Partial pre-rendering

By default the command `$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender` pre-renders all our pages.
To pre-render only some pages, we can use the <Link href="/command-prerender" text={<><code>partial</code> option</>} /> and <Link href="/doNotPrerender" text={<code>.page.server.js#doNotPrerender</code>} />


## SSG vs SSR

The only difference between using `$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender` (SSG) and using [`renderPage()`](/createPageRenderer) (SSR) is when the HTML of pages are rendered:
- SSG: our pages' HTML are rendered at build-time (when we call the `$ vite-plugin-ssr prerender` command)
- SSR: our pages' HTML are rendered at request-time (when the user goes to our website and `renderPage()` is called)

> Client-side code is loaded & executed in the user's browser and is therefore always executed at request-time.


## Should I pre-render?

We should use pre-rendering whenever we can. Because pre-rendering removes the need for a Node.js server which makes deployment an order of magnitude easier. It's also more performant as HTML isn't re-generated on every request.

The problem is that pre-rendering cannot be used for every kind of website. So the question of whether to use pre-rendering boils down to: can I use pre-rendering?

Pre-rendering cannot be used for websites that have highly dynamic content. For example, a social site such as [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) has highly dynamic content: the content changes every time a user posts a new link or writes a new comment. We cannot use pre-rendering because with pre-rendering the HTML is stuck at build-time and we cannot re-build the entire website every time there is new content.

Pre-rendering works for websites with content that changes only occasionally, such as a few times a day. For example, `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` is updated only occasionally, and the entire `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` website can be re-build every time the `vite-plugin-ssr` maintainers change its content. Pre-rendering enables the deployment of `https://vite-plugin-ssr.com` to <Link href="/github-pages" text="GitHub Pages" /> which is an order of magnitude easier (and more performant) than using a Node.js production server.
