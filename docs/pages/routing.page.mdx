By default `vite-plugin-ssr` does:
 - Server Routing, but we can use Client Routing instead.
 - Filesystem Routing, but we can also use *Route Strings* and *Route Functions* to define advanced routes.

## Server Routing or Client Routing?

`vite-plugin-ssr` hast first-class support for both Server-side Routing (full HTML reload upon page navigation) and Client-side Routing (DOM mutations upon page navigation).

The guide [Server Routing VS Client Routing](/SR-vs-CR) helps us choose which one to use.
