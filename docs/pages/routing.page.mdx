By default `vite-plugin-ssr` does:
 - Server Routing, but we can use Client Routing instead.
 - Filesystem Routing, but we can also use *Route Strings* and *Route Functions* to define advanced routes.

## Server Routing or Client Routing?

`vite-plugin-ssr` hast first-class support for both Server-side Routing (full HTML reload upon page navigation) and Client-side Routing (DOM mutations upon page navigation).

The guide [Server Routing VS Client Routing](/SR-vs-CR) helps us choose which one to use.

## React Router / Vue Router

Instead of using React Router or Vue Router, we recommend only using `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router.

That said, `vite-plugin-ssr` has support for both Vue Router and React Router, see the [Vue Router & React Router](/vue-router-and-react-router) guide.
