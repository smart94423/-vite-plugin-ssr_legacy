By default `vite-plugin-ssr` does:
 - Server-side Routing, but we can use Client-side Routing instead.
 - Filesystem Routing, but we can use *Route Strings* and *Route Functions* to define advanced routes.

## Server-side Routing or Client-side Routing?

`vite-plugin-ssr` hast first-class support for both Server-side Routing (full HTML reload upon page navigation) and Client-side Routing (DOM mutations upon page navigation).

In general, we recommand using Server-side Routing because it usually leads to faster dev speed.
