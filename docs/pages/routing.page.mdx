By default `vite-plugin-ssr` does:
 - Server Routing, but we can use Client Routing instead.
 - Filesystem Routing, but we can use *Route Strings* and *Route Functions* to define advanced routes.

## Server Routing or Client Routing?

`vite-plugin-ssr` hast first-class support for both Server Routing (full HTML reload upon page navigation) and Client Routing (DOM mutations upon page navigation).

In general, we recommend using Server Routing because it leads to a simpler app architecture and, consequently, to a faster app development.
