A recurring problem when doing SSR are so-called *hydration mismatches*.

## Hydration mismatch

> We recommand having a clear understanding of what hydration is, see: [What is hydration?](/hydration)

A hydration mismatch is when the content rendered to HTML in Node.js is not the same than the content rendered in the browser.

For example, if we render the current date's milliseconds (`<span>{ new Date().getMilliseconds() }</span>`) then there will be a mismatch because the milliseconds rendered to HTML
`<span>123</span>`
won't match the milliseconds rendered on the browser-side `<span>167</span>`.

Hydration mismatches
can induce performance degradation
and bugs and should therefore be avoided.

## Common causes & solutions

Common causes:
 - **Rendered content is actually different**. Make sure that your components render the same content in Node.js as well as in the browser.
 - **Browser cache**: While developing, make sure to disable your browser's cache to ensure that your browser doesn't load cached & outdated JavaScript.

With React:
 - **Old React versions** are buggy around stiching text segments leading to `Warning: Text content did not match.`. Make sure to use the latest React version.

With Vue:
 - When using Client Routing, make sure to **use the [`ensureHydration: true`](/useClientRouter) option** because Vue always needs the first render to be a hydration. (In other words, the first render should never be interrupted: a client-side routing trigged by the user clicking on a link should await hydration before proceeding instead of interrupting the hydration process.)
