Normally, the `dist/server/` files are automatically loaded.

But, in some (rare) situations, the mechanism used by `vite-plugin-ssr` doesn't work and we need to manually load the `dist/server/` files:

```js
// server.js

// Load `dist/server/` files
import './path/to/dist/server/importBuild.cjs'
/* Or:
require('./path/to/dist/server/importBuild.cjs')
*/
```

> Reach out to the `vite-plugin-ssr` maintainers if you have problems importing `dist/server/importBuild.cjs`.
