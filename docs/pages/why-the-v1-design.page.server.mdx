The V1 design adds new foundational capabilities.

For example, you'll able to implement a custom config `ssr: boolean` to seamlessly toggle render modes:

```js
// /pages/admin/+config.js

export default {
  // We render the Admin Panel as SPA
  ssr: false
}
```

> VPS will release official React/Vue/Solid renderers that already implement such flag. (You'll be able to eject these renderers for complete control.)

You'll even be able to toggle renderers:

```js
// /pages/admin/+config.js

import graphqlRenderer from 'vike-react-relay'

export default {
  // We use GraphQL for the Admin Panel
  renderer: graphqlRenderer
}
```

> The `vite-plugin-ssr` project is going to be [renamed to Vike](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/736).

```js
// /pages/product/@id/+config.js

import rpcRenderer from 'vike-react-telefunc'

export default {
  // We use RPC for the product pages
  renderer: rpcRenderer
}
```

```js
// /pages/live-ticker/+config.js

import solidRenderer from 'vike-solid'

export default {
  // We use Solid for this page while the rest of our app uses React
  renderer: solidRenderer
}
```

The V1 design also brings new foundational capabilities for buidling frameworks on top of VPS.
