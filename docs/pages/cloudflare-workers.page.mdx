## `importBuild.js`

To be able to deploy a `vite-plugin-ssr` app to Cloudflare Workers, we need to load `dist/server/importBuild.js` in our worker code.

> Cloudflare Workers needs the entire server file to be bundled into a single file; `dist/server/importBuild.js` helps bundlers discover the entire dependency tree.

See examples below.

## Dev Server

We recommend using Vite with an Express.js dev server for lightning fast HMR & dev start,
and for production to bundle your worker code with Cloudflare Workers's webpack bundler.
See examples below.

## Examples

 - React: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers/' />
 - Vue + HTML streaming: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers-vue-html-streaming/' />
