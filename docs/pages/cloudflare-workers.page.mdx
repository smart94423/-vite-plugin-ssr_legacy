## `importBuild.js`

We need to load `dist/server/importBuild.js` in our worker code. Example: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers/worker/ssr.js' />.

> Cloudflare Workers needs our entire worker code to be bundled into a single file, which [`dist/server/importBuild.js` enables us to do](/importBuild.js).

## Dev Server

We recommend using Vite with an Express.js dev server for lightning fast HMR & dev start,
and for production to bundle the worker code with Cloudflare Workers's webpack bundler.
See examples.

## Bundling

By default, we recommend using Cloudflare Workers's webpack bundler because it's the beaten path;
using another bundler may cause subtle differences that may cause problems with Cloudflare Workers.

That said, we can use any other bundler (esbuild, rollup, ...) to bundle our worker code;
we just need to make sure to `import './path/to/dist/server/importBuild.js'` ([`importBuild.js`](#importbuild-js) works with any bundler).

## Universal `fetch()`

When using Node.js for dev and Cloudflare Workers for production, we may need a `fetch()` function that works in both environments.

But libraries such as `node-fetch` or `cross-fetch` usually don't work with Cloudflare Workers.

What we can do is to define a fetch function at `pageContext.fetch` that works in all environments.
The trick is to add a different `fetch()` implementation to `pageContextInit` at [`renderPage(pageContextInit)`](createPageRenderer).

See example at <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers#universal-fetch' />.
