import { RepoLink } from 'libframe-docs/components/RepoLink'

To deploy a `vite-plugin-ssr` app to Cloudflare Workers we load `dist/server/importBuild.js` in our worker code.

> Cloudflare Workers needs the entire server file to be bundled into a single file; `dist/server/importBuild.js` helps bundlers discover the entire dependency tree.

Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers/' />
