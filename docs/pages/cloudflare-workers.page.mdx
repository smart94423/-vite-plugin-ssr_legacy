## `importBuild.js`

We need to load `dist/server/importBuild.js` in our worker code. Example: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers/worker/ssr.js' />.

> Cloudflare Workers needs our entire worker code to be bundled into a single file, which [`dist/server/importBuild.js` enables us to do](/importBuild.js).

## Dev Server

We recommend using Vite with an Express.js dev server for lightning fast HMR & dev start,
and for production to bundle the worker code with Cloudflare Workers's webpack bundler.
See examples below.

## Examples

 - React: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers/' />
 - Vue + HTML streaming: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers-vue-html-streaming/' />
