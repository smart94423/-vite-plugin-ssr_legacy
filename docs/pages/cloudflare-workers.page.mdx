## Examples

 - React: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers/' />
 - Vue: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers-vue/' />


## Bundling

Cloudflare Workers requires your entire worker code to be bundled into a single file.

> Cloudflare uses the term "worker code" to denote server code that is run on its edge infrastructure.

We recommend using [`build-worker`](https://github.com/brillout/build-worker) (which uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)) instead of wrangler to bundle your worker code.

> Wrangler v1 uses webpack v4 which is outdated and has many problems.
> <br/>
> Wrangler v2 uses esbuild but it's not production ready.

The bundle size of your worker should not exceed **1MB**, but your can request sizes of up to 100MB and beyond:
 - [Cloudflare Workers > Larger Scripts](https://www.cloudflare.com/larger-scripts-on-workers-early-access/)
 - [Cloudflare Workers > Limits > Script Size] https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#script-size

## Cloudflare Pages

With [wrangler v2](https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler2), we can deploy server code (with Cloudflare Workers) along static files (with Cloudflare Pages).

Example:
 - [github.com/Immortalin/vite-plugin-ssr-cloudflare-pages-demo](https://github.com/Immortalin/vite-plugin-ssr-cloudflare-pages-demo)

## Development

For developing your app, we recommend, whenever possible, to use Express.js instead of wrangler. Leading to a significantly faster development experience.

This means:
 - Skip `wrangler` / `miniflare` / Cloudflare Workers altogether while developing your app.
 - Use `wrangler` (or `miniflare`) to preview your worker.
 - Use `wrangler` to deploy your worker to Cloudflare Workers.

See the setup of the [examples](#examples).


## Universal `fetch()`

When using Node.js for development and Cloudflare Workers for production, we may need a `fetch()` function that works in both environments.

But libraries such as `node-fetch` or `cross-fetch` usually don't work with Cloudflare Workers.

What we can do is to define a fetch function at `pageContext.fetch` that works in all environments.
The trick is to add a different `fetch()` implementation to `pageContextInit` at [`renderPage(pageContextInit)`](createPageRenderer).

Example: <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers#universal-fetch' />.
