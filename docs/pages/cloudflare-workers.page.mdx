import { RepoLink } from './components/RepoLink'

We make sure to load `dist/server/importBuild.js` in our worker code which allows us to bundle the worker code into a single file.
(`dist/server/importBuild.js` loads modules living in `dist/` in a way that bundlers can determine the dependency tree at build-time.)

Example:
 - <RepoLink path='/examples/cloudflare-workers/' />
