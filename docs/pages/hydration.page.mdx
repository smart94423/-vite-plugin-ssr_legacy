export const noHeading = true
export const pageTitle = 'What is Hydration?'

When doing SSR our pages are rendered to HTML. But HTML alone is not sufficient to make a page interactive.
For example, a page with zero browser-side JavaScript cannot be interactive (there are no JavaScript event handlers to react to user actions such as a click on a button).

To make our page interactive, in addition to render our page to HTML in Node.js, our view framework (Vue/React/...) also loads and renders the page in the browser. (It creates an internal representation of the page's elements and maps them to the DOM elements of the rendered HTML.)

This process is called *hydration*. Informally speaking: it's what brings our page alive.
