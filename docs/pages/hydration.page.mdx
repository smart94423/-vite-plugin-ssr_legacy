## What is hydration?

When using SSR our pages are rendered to HTML. But to make a page interactive HTML alone is not sufficient.

To make our page interactive, our view framework (Vue/React/...) renders the page a second time on the client-side. (Technically speaking: it renders the page into an internal representation and maps it to the DOM elements of the already rendered HTML.)

This process is called *hydration*. (Informally speaking: hydration is what brings our page "alive".)

If we were to have zero browser-side JavaScript (with `vite-plugin-ssr` we can do this by defining an empty `_default.page.client.js` file), then our page is not hydrated (since the client-side doesn't execute any JavaScript) and our page is not interactive.

## Hydration Mismatch

As explained in the previous section, when using SSR, our view framework (React/Vue/...) renders our page twice:
 1. A first time to HTML on the server-side.
 2. A second time on the browser-side.

A mismatch is when the rendered HTML is not the same then what is rendered a second time on the browser-side.

## Suppress Hydration Mismatch Warning

In general, we should avoid hydration mismatches by making sure that what is rendered on the client-side is the same than what is rendered to HTML on the server-side.

But there are situations where mismatches are inevitable. To suppress hydration mismatch warnings:
