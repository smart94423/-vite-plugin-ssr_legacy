The vite-plugin-ssr project has been renamed to Vike ([vike.dev](https://vike.dev/)).

Functionally, nothing changes: it's just a new name for the same tool.

There are no breaking changes: the only change is that, starting from version `0.4.142`, you'll have to use the [npm package `vike`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vike) instead of the [npm package `vite-plugin-ssr`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-ssr). We recommend applying following find-and-replace bash script:
```bash
grep ite-plugin-ssr --exclude-dir node_modules/ --exclude-dir .git/ | xargs sed -i 's/ite-plugin-ssr/ike/g'
```

> `0.4.142` is the only version that is dual published as `vite-plugin-ssr@0.4.142`/`vike@0.4.142`, enabling you to migrate to `vike` simply applying this bash script.

> If this bash script doesn't work out for you, let us know.

If you use [`vike-react`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-react)/[`vike-vue`](https://github.com/vikejs/vike-vue)/[`vike-solid`](https://github.com/magne4000/vike-solid) then we recommend to update it to the latest version.
