1. Update to the latest `0.4` version (`0.4.x`), follow the deprecation warnings which include instructions of how to update outdated code. (TODO/v1-release: replace `x` with actual version number.)
1. All types are now exported at `'vite-plugin-ssr'`, and note that `PageContextBuiltIntClient` has been renamed:
   ```diff
   - import type { PageContextBuiltIntClient } from 'vite-plugin/client/router'
   + import type { PageContextBuiltIntClientWithClientRouting as PageContextBuiltIntClient } from 'vite-plugin-ssr'

   - import type { PageContextBuiltIntClient } from 'vite-plugin/client'
   + import type { PageContextBuiltIntClientWithServerRouting as PageContextBuiltIntClient } from 'vite-plugin-ssr'
   ```

That's it! Welcome to the `v1` release.
