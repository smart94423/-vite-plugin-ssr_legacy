1. Update to the latest `0.4` version (`0.4.x`), follow the deprecation warnings which include instructions of how to update outdated code. (TODO/v1-release: replace `x` with actual version number.)
1. All types have been moved to `'vite-plugin-ssr/types'`:
   ```diff
   - import type { SomeType } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/any-path'
   + import type { SomeType } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/types'
   ```
   And `PageContextBuiltIntClient` has been renamed to `PageContextBuiltIntClientWithClientRouting` and `PageContextBuiltIntClientWithServerRouting`:
   ```diff
   - import type { PageContextBuiltIntClient } from 'vite-plugin/client/router'
   + import type {
   +   PageContextBuiltIntClientWithClientRouting as
   +   PageContextBuiltIntClient
   + } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/types'

   - import type { PageContextBuiltIntClient } from 'vite-plugin/client'
   + import type {
   +   PageContextBuiltIntClientWithServerRouting as
   +   PageContextBuiltIntClient
   + } from 'vite-plugin-ssr/types'
   ```

That's it! Welcome to the `v1` release.
