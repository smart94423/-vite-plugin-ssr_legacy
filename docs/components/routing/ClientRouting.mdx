Client(-side) Routing denotes the practice of implementing page navigation on the client-side:
when the user navigates to a new page,
instead of discarding the current page and requesting the HTML of the new page,
the client preserves the current page and renders the new page by manipulating the DOM of the page.

Client Routing enables:
- Faster page navigation.
- Client-side state preserved across navigation.
- Custom page transition animations.

We further discuss these use cases at <Link href="/server-routing-vs-client-routing#which-one-to-choose" />.

We use <Link text={<code>useClientRouter()</code>} href="/useClientRouter" /> to implement Client Routing.
