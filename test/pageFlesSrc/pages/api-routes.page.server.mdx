In order to keep `vite-plugin-ssr` lean and focused,
`vite-plugin-ssr` does not support [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).

Instead,
we can use our server framework to implement API endpoints,
for example by creating Express.js routes.
Or we can use API tools such as GraphQL.

> The `vite-plugin-ssr` creator is working on an RPC implementation called [*Telefunc*](https://telefunc.com) that has first-class support for SSR.
