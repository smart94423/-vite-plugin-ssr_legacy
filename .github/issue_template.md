:shield:   **RULE**

*Issues.*

:red_circle: **Bad**: "We have this error coming from tool X. Tool X is not a Vike tool, can you help?" Ask tool X instead of asking us. Only ask us if you believe your problem to be related to our tools.
:green_circle: **Good**: "We have this error coming from a Vike tool." Post the full stack trace, so we can start fixing the error right away :-).
:red_circle: **Bad**: "Our app is broken and we don't know why, can you help?" We won't help with problems unrelated to our tools. Again, only ask us if you have evidence that your problem is related to our tools.
:red_circle: **Bad**: "We are using an old version of a Vike tool and it doesn't work." Make sure to use the latest version. The problem may have already been fixed.

*Feature Requests.*

:green_circle: **Good**: "How can we use Vike tools to achieve our use case?" We are more than happy to discuss use cases and feature requests.

*Questions.*

:green_circle: **Good**: "I don't understand the docs. Can you help?" If the docs fail at explaining, that's on us. We are happy to help and we'll improve the docs.
