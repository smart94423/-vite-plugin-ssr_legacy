        :red_circle: **Bad**: "We have this error coming from tool X, can you help?" Ask tool X instead of asking us. Only ask us if you believe your problem to be related to vite-plugin-ssr.
        <br/>
        :green_circle: **Good**: "We have this error coming from a vite-plugin-ssr." Post the full stack trace, so we can start fixing the error right away :-).
        <br/>
        :red_circle: **Bad**: "Our app is broken and we don't know why, can you help?" We won't help with problems unrelated to vite-plugin-ssr. Again, only ask us if you have evidence that your problem is related to vite-plugin-ssr.
        <br/>
        :red_circle: **Bad**: "We are using an old version of vite-plugin-ssr and it doesn't work." Make sure to use the latest version. The problem may have already been fixed.
