        :red_circle: **Bad**: We won't help with problems unrelated to vite-plugin-ssr. Only ask us if you have evidence that your problem is related to vite-plugin-ssr.
        > We have this error originating from vite-plugin-ssr.
        
        :green_circle: **Good**: Post the error message and error stack, we'll start fixing the error right away (usually under 24 hours).
