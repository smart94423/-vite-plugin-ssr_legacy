        :red_circle: **Bad**: Ask tool X instead of asking us. Only ask us if you believe your problem to be related to vite-plugin-ssr.

        :red_circle: **Bad**: We won't help with problems unrelated to vite-plugin-ssr. Only ask us if you have evidence that your problem is related to vite-plugin-ssr.
        > We have this error originating from vite-plugin-ssr.
        
        :green_circle: **Good**: Post the full stack trace, so we can start fixing the error right away :-).
