- Add Vike.PageContext
  - improve TypeScript DX for `abortReason`
  - improve TypeScript DX for `usePageContext()`
- Set env type to `{ client: boolean | '_eager', server: boolean | '_eager', config?: boolean }`
  - Eager means that the value is always loaded, no matter what page is being loaded. (By default only the values of the page being renderered are loaded.)
  - Should the option be '_eager' and internal? Is there any added value to make it internal? Custom configs are only meant for advanced use cases anyways. Maybe naming it 'eager' (instead of '_eager') while omitting 'eager` in the Meta type until some user needs it?
  - Values that are defined in `+config.h.js` are loaded at config-time even if `config: false`. (But they can be defined in a `+{configName}.js` and they won't be loaded then.)
- fix pageContext._renderHook.hookFilePath / replace with new prop hookSrc
- refacor/fix skipConfigValue to differentiate between global/page virtual file
- use json-s instead of JSON

- By default, only call guard() hooks on the server-side?

- release 0.5.0
  - `import * from 'vite-plugin-ssr'`
  - pageContext.url
  - rename hooks for 0.4 designA?

  client/runtime-server-routing/
  client/runtime-client-routing/
  client/router.js
