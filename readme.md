### What is this?

Vite Plugin for SSR.

### Status

:white_check_mark: Design.<br/>
:white_check_mark: Basic working prototype.<br/>
:construction: Feature completeness, docs, polish details.

### Features

- **Do-one-thing-do-it-well Tool**: `vite-plugin-ssr` only takes care of SSR. The rest of the stack is up to you: `vite-plugin-ssr` works with any view framework (Vue, React, etc.), any view library (Vuex, React Router, etc.), and any server framework (Express, Koa, Hapi, Fastify, etc.).
- **Simple but Powerful:** `vite-plugin-ssr` has been carefully designed to be simple, while allowing you to have full control not only over your tech stack, but also over how & when your pages are rendered.
- **Pre-render / SSG / Static Websites:** Deploy your app to a static host by pre-rendering all your pages.
- **Scalable:** Thanks to Vite's radical new approach of lazy transpiling & loading everything, Vite apps can scale to thousands of modules with no hit on dev speed.
- **Fast Production Cold Start:** `vite-plugin-ssr` lazy loads your pages; adding pages doesn't increase cold start.
- **Small but Sturdy:** `vite-plugin-ssr`'s source code is an order of magnitude smaller than SSR frameworks. A smaller source code leads to not only a more robust tool, but also a tool that can quickly adapt to a fast evolving Vite & JavaScript ecosystem.

**Want something?** Search [GitHub issues](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/) if someone has already requested what you want and upvote it, or open a new issue if not. Roadmap is prioritized based on user feedback.
